"28 December, 2023 ",Maharashtra: ‘What will they do with the seats?’ asks Congress as it rejects Uddhav Sena’s demand for 23 seats for Lok Sabha elections,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/maharashtra-congress-rejects-uddhav-senas-demand-for-23-seats-for-lok-sabha-elections/,"Former Chief Minister and senior Maharashtra Congress leader Ashok Chavan stated that the parties needed to adjust. ""While every party desires a larger share of seats, the demand for 23 seats by the Shiv Sena was excessive given the current circumstances,"" he said.The Congress Party has rejected the Shiv Sena’s (UBT) demand for 23 seats in Maharashtra in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The development came after Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi partners Shiv Sena (UBT), Congress, and NCP met to talk about seat sharing for the Lok Sabha elections.Despite the majority of its members supporting CM Eknath Shinde’s faction, the UBT Sena reportedly demanded 23 of the 48 seats in Maharashtra. According to Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam, Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena faction faces an enormous obstacle because it lacks sufficient candidates due to the party’s division.Following the splits in the Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar’s NCP, Congress representatives at the meeting stated unequivocally that the grand old party seems to be the only one with an established vote share in the state.Former Chief Minister and senior Maharashtra Congress leader Ashok Chavan stated that the parties needed to adjust. “While every party desires a larger share of seats, the demand for 23 seats by the Shiv Sena was excessive given the current circumstances,” he said.According to Sanjay Nirupam, leaders ought to prevent conflicts over winning seats. “The Shiv Sena may demand 23 seats, but what will they do with them? The Shiv Sena’s leaders have left, resulting in a crisis. Shiv Sena faces a candidate shortage,” he said. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut stated last week that he and party leaders Uddhav Thackeray and Aaditya Thackeray met with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, senior leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, as well as AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, before the recent Opposition bloc I.N.D.I Alliance meeting.Raut did not specify how many seats the Congress and NCP would contest. The Shiv Sena was part of the BJP-led NDA alliance in 2019. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party is now a member of the MVA, along with the Congress and the NCP.Eknath Shinde and 40 other Shiv Sena MLAs ‘revolted’ against the Shiv Sena leadership in June 2022, resulting in a party split and the collapse of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Shinde then joined forces with the BJP to form the state government.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"28 December, 2023 ","ED now confirms OpIndia’s 2019 newsbreak, names Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in charge sheet highlighting dubious land deals and Sanjay Bhandari links",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ed-confirms-opindias-2019-newsbreak-names-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-in-charge-sheet-for-dubious-land-deals-and-sanjay-bhandari-links/,"This is the first time that ED has named Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in their chargesheet. ED's chargesheet confirms OpIndia's 2019 newsbreak regarding the Gandhi connection to the dubious land deals.On Thursday (December 27), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) named Robert Vadra for the first time in its supplementary chargesheet in the money laundering case against arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. The ED established a direct connection between the Gandhi son-in-law Robert Vadra, CC Thampi and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. In the chargesheet, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s name has also featured. Priyanka has been named in connection with a dubious land purchase and sale to an individual named HL Pahwa. That story was first broken y OpIndia in 2019. The ED on the 22nd of December told the Special Court that CC Thampi, who worked for the absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, is a close aide of Robert Vadra – the husband of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The link has been established by the ED in the supplementary chargesheet filed against CC Thampi and Sumit Chadha (said to be a close relative of Sanjay Bhandari) in a money laundering case.This is the first time that ED has named Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in their chargesheet. ED’s chargesheet confirms OpIndia’s 2019 newsbreak regarding the Gandhi connection to the dubious land deals. “Further, Smt. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wife of Sh. Robert Vadra also purchased agricultural land measuring 40 kanal (05 acres) in village Amipur, District Faridabad, Haryana from Sh. H.L. Pahwa in April, 2006…,” ED chargsheet reads.Back in 2019, OpIndia had unearthed papers that linked Rahul Gandhi himself to Sanjay Bhandari through a string of dubious land deals involving HL Pahwa and CC Thampi – who the ED has now acknowledged is a close aide of Robert Vadra.These papers are related to the ED search conducted on one HL Pahwa on 3rd May 2017 and 4th May 2017. The land dealings are between Rahul Gandhi and H L Pahwa who was funded by CC Thampi – CC Thampi was known to be a close aide of Robert Vadra. As per the ED chargesheet filed in the PMLA court on 22nd December, CC Thampi has stated to ED that he was introduced to Robert Vadra by Sonia Gandhi’s PA Madhavan. OpIndia revealed in 2019 that not only Rahul Gandhi but also Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had purchased land from HL Pahwa. According to a sale deed dated 3 March 2008, Gurgaon resident HL Pahwa sold nine acres of land in Hasanpur village in Haryana’s Palwal district to Robert Vadra for Rs 36.9 lakh. In addition, a sale record from Rajasthan’s Bikaner district shows that Sarita Devi Bothra, 42, sold 4.63 acres of land in Basti village in Ganganagar tehsil for Rs 8.5 lakh to Real Earth Estate Private Limited, a New Delhi-based company, in April 2009. Notably, Robert Vadra is the company’s director.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also bought land from HL Pahwa. OpIndia earlier reported that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra purchased land and then sold it for an inflated price to the same person four years later. The person in question was also HL Pahwa. On April 28, 2006, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra purchased land from HL Pahwa for Rs. 15,00,000 in two cheques, and subsequently sold it back to HL Pahwa for Rs. 84,15,006 via multiple cheques on February 17, 2010.As reported earlier, here the link between HL Pahwa and CC Thampi emerges. When Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sold the land back to HL Pahwa at an exorbitant price, Pahwa repaid Gandhi in five instalments between May 22nd and September 11th, 2009. The stated reason for the instalment payment was ‘non-availability of funds’.CC Thampi was arrested in 2020 and is currently out on bail. In February 2019, Robert Vadra was grilled for over 5 hours for his alleged links to CC Thampi. The Enforcement Directorate suspects kickbacks for a petroleum deal in 2009 were routed through the Sharjah-based company, allegedly controlled by a UAE-based NRI businessman, CC Thampi. Vadra was also questioned about owning Benami property in London along with CC Thampi and Sanjay Bhandari. Thampi has a company in UAE called Sky Light and in India, Skylight Hospitality Private Limited is allegedly linked to Vadra and is under the ED scanner for suspect land deals in Bikaner, Rajasthan. ED had served him a show-cause notice last year for violation of laws in the acquisition of agricultural and other lands in and around Delhi-NCR in deals amounting to over Rs 288 crore.The ED chargesheet mentions that between 2005 and 2008 Thampi purchased around 486 acres of land from Pahwa in the same Amipur village in Faridabad. The chargesheet mentions that Pahwa was receiving cash ‘out of the books’ when Priyanka sold the land to him. Also, Robert Vadra reportedly did not pay the entire sale consideration to Pahwa. CC Thampi is accused number 7 in the ED’s PMLA case against Sanjay Bhandari and associates. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"28 December, 2023 ","‘Make Mayawati PM candidate if you want BSP in I.N.D.I. Alliance’, says BSP MP Malook Nagar",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bsp-will-join-i-n-d-i-alliance-if-mayawati-is-made-pm-candidate-mp-malook-nagar/,"BSP MP Malook Nagar said, ""To effectively challenge the BJP, the I.N.D.I. alliance must nominate Mayawati as their candidate for Prime Minister. If that does not happen, no coalition stands a chance against Modi.""On Wednesday (27th December), BSP MP from Bijnor Malook Nagar said that the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will consider joining the I.N.D.I. alliance if it makes BSP-supremo Mayawati the Prime Ministerial candidate in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections of 2024. This statement by Mayawati’s close aide Malook Nagar has come after UP Congress president Ajay Rai suggested the BSP should seriously consider joining the I.N.D.I. alliance.BSP MP Malook Nagar added that the Congress must apologise for weaning away BSP MLAs in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan after the 2018 assembly elections. He claimed that Mayawati is the tallest Dalit leader in the country and support for her cuts across states. He said, “By projecting Mayawati as the PM candidate, the INDIA alliance will be able to stop the BJP from winning a third consecutive term in the upcoming Lok Sabha election. To effectively challenge the BJP, the I.N.D.I. alliance must nominate Mayawati as their candidate for Prime Minister. If that does not happen, no coalition stands a chance against Modi.”Malook Nagar further said, “The victory formula for the alliance is clear. In the 2022 (Uttar Pradesh) assembly election, the BJP polled 41.3% votes. The parties constituting the INDIA bloc polled around 40% votes and the BSP secured around 13% votes. If the BSP joins the alliance, the vote percentage will go above 50% which is enough to snatch power from the BJP.”The BSP leader added, ” The projection of Mayawati as the PM candidate will also bring back the Dalit voters who have been lured by the saffron brigade. The I.N.D.I. alliance should decide to project the BSP chief as the PM candidate. Mayawati will (then) not only forgive the Congress for its misdeed to poach the BSP MLAs in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh but will also have a positive approach towards the I.N.D.I. alliance offer.”Malook Nagar said, “No matter how much anyone discusses Ram temple, it will benefit the BJP. Ram belongs to all of us, not just the BJP, but the politics and questions raised about the temple will benefit the BJP in the coming days.”Notably, Congress is willing to take BSP along in the I.N.D.I. alliance. However, other parties in the alliance are not welcoming BSP. Especially, the Samajwadi Party of Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Dal of Jayant Choudhari are not willing to join hands with the BSP.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"27 December, 2023 ","As goons attack shops over ‘smaller Kannada fonts’ on signboards in Bengaluru, here is how Karnataka Congress leaders have been fanning the language divide...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/here-is-how-congress-leaders-has-been-fanning-the-language-row-that-led-to-pro-kannada-violence/,"In May this year, just before the Assemby elections, Congress and other opposition leaders spread mass hysteria that ‘outside’ companies (non-Karnataka-based) will trample the local businesses, which could lead to ‘cultural, political, lingual, and economic subjugation’. Tensions have been escalating in Karnataka particularly Bengaluru after several outfits carried out violent protests over the language row. Members of pro-Kannada activist group Karnataka Rakshana Vedike stormed the streets in Bengaluru on 27th December (Wednesday). As per reports, the protestors pelted stones and vandalised and defaced the properties of several business establishments after accusing them of not using or boldly highlighting the mandated percentage of Kannada language in their signboards.  Conspicuously, the goons displaying violent linguistic chauvinism gained strength from the fact that the administration and ruling party leaders had made statements fanning the language divide. Two days ago, the BBMP order made it mandatory to display signage covering 60% of space with content in the Kannada language while the rest 40% could be in English. And Karnataka Rakshana Vedike is demanding immediate implementation of this rule. They even attacked establishments having separate English and Kannada signboards, demanding that all signboards must have Kannada occupying at least 60% space.The today’s vandalism comes after repeated comments of ruling Congress leaders, both before and after the elections, calling for wider use of Kannada in the state.Earlier on 17th October, Karnataka CM and Congress stalwart Siddaramaiah asserted that everyone living in Karnataka should learn to speak Kannada. He said, “We are all Kannadigas, people speaking different languages have settled in Kannada land since the unification of Karnataka. Everyone living in Karnataka should learn to speak Kannada.”He argued that in some parts, other language speakers didn’t learn or speak anything in Kannada for which he blamed the negligence and generosity of Kannadigas that allowed it.    He demanded that Kannadigas should ask non-Kannada speakers to learn their language instead of themselves learning other languages. He added, “Instead of Kannadigas teaching our language to others, we are learning their language first. In some parts of the state, the diaspora does not speak Kannada at all. This is happening because of the generosity of the Kannadigas.”The Chief Minister noted that although Kannada had been the official language for many years, negligence might have been the main reason behind the non-implementation of Kannada in the administration. He stressed that while one should respect other languages, one should not forget their own language. In May this year, just before the Assemby elections, Congress and other opposition leaders spread mass hysteria that ‘outside’ companies (non-Karnataka-based) will trample the local businesses, which could lead to ‘cultural, political, lingual, and economic subjugation’. The Congress party and its ecosystem which was also assisted by JDS back then, used the Amul-Nandini controversy to whip up regionalism and linguistic chauvinism by framing non-Kanadigas as outsiders, potential usurpers and cultural imperalists. Former Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah even appealed to the Kannadigas to boycott the Amul brand as it was not based in the state.While speaking about the matter, he had said, “In addition to language treason by the imposition of Hindi and land treason by trespassing within the state borders, now the BJP government is going to betray the farmers by shutting down Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), which is the livelihood of millions of dairy farming families in the country.”Congress leader DK Shivakumar suggested a larger conspiracy in the entry of Amul into the Karnataka market. The controversy fueled sub-regionalism and stroked langague and culture war. An escalated langauge war also erupted after the prominent opposition leaders from Congress went after labels on FMCG products particularly Dahi.  Additionally, on the counting day for assembly elections, Congress CM candidate Siddaramaiah had reprimanded journalists for using Hindi. Responding to media queries, he dragged the language divide, refused to answer questions in Hindi, and asked reporters to either use English or Kannada.In April 2022, in a controversial response to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s opinion that Hindi could be looked at as an alternative to English, the Congress leader had asserted that Hindi is not India’s national language and he will never let it happen. He alleged that it was an agenda of unleashing “cultural terrorism” against non-Hindi-speaking states.He had demanded, “It is time for the BJP to understand that more linguistic and cultural autonomy should be given to states.” The language war stroked in the guise of so-called Hindi imposition and protection of interests of Karnataka had led to mainstreaminging rabid lingiustic chauvinist groups like Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) which has been working in tandem with Congress party on host of issues for years. Reportedly, it is the KRV that led today’s violent protests across the city coercing shopkeepers and vendors to make an immediate transition and using Kannada on their signboards.During the Amul-Nandini fiasco, joining and supporting the then opposition party Congress’ narrative and call, Members of the ‘Kannada Rakshana Vedike’ had also hit the streets and staged protests against Amul while furthering its agenda of linguistic chauvinism and Hindi-imposition rhetoric.  During the Cauvery water dispute this year, organisations like KRV meet Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah to extend their support. They also called a bandh over the issue.Incidentally, just like the anti-farm law protest in New Delhi after the Centre passed three agriculture laws, the Karnataka Congress worked in tandem with outfits like KRV and staged violent protest against two amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms (KLR) Act and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act passed by the BS Yediyurappa government in 2020. Meanwhile, for several years, T-shirts with slogans like, “Hindi Gotthilla Hogo. Naavu Kannadigaru, Naavu Dravidaru” (We don’t know Hindi, go away. We are Kannadigas, we are Dravidians), have been allowed to go mainstream on social media platforms regularly. Similar campaigns have also been running in Tamil Nadu. A similar hashtag #ServeInMyLanguage had demanded that government services should be made available in Kannada for Kannada-speaking people. These hashtags started by the Kannada Grahakara Koota fan language divide and have been followed by groups like Karnataka Rakshana Vedike that hit the streets on to protest to fight against the so-called imposition of Hindi. Incidentally, these outfits have been on the same page with the Congress party in the state and vice-versa, emboldening them. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 December, 2023 ",Is Raghuram Rajan the ‘disease’ or a symptom of a wider disease: Defining the Woke problem and what the solution can be,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/raghuram-rajan-symptom-disease-woke-problem-solution/,"The Jewish lobby has already found their most potent cure – just cut off the funds. It is producing results. A lot of the leftist academics have started crawling, walking back on naked antisemitism, and issuing holy statements drafted by costly PR agencies. Some, like Gay, are holding out, backed as they are by powerful forces including likes of Obama.Is Rajan just a disease or a symptom of a much wider disease?First, let me apologise for using this rather strong term to describe a man, for all his defects, is intelligent, erudite, and accomplished. With my limited English, I could not find anything better. There is no personal insult meant. I am merely questioning his politics which I am entitled to as a citizen.Let us take each of the two options one by one and see where they fall. I leave it to you to be the judge!First, let us consider if he is just a “disease” and not something worse.His recent statements (and ones not so recent as well) have bordered on the bizarre and ludicrous. I would not bore you with the details since there are excellent articles that deal with that topic – such as the recent one by Karuna Gopal and Abhishek Banerji. I have also written about his assault on PLI and manufacturing which were dangerous. Other renowned academics have confirmed I was on the right track by saying India needs manufacturing jobs. His open endorsement of Rahul Gandhi and not-so-successful attempts to quote the Shehzade with multiple coats of intellectual paint that seems to wash off quickly are bad enough. And then he supports the likes of P. Chidambaram and his son who face serious allegations of corruption. As if all that were not enough, he did one better than Jairam Ramesh by trying to provide an anti-Modi spin on the huge cash haul at the premises of a Congress MP. I am trying hard to differentiate between him and Mani Shankar Aiyar but so far have been unsuccessful. At least Mani Shankar is no hypocrite and no one outside of the Palazzo servant quarters takes him seriously. And he seems to be not stopping there. Pragya Mishra is his next target to overtake! What next? Beat Supriya Shrinate?Only Rajan himself can explain the reasons and motives, I can only speculate. My guess is, that he is desperate to become India’s next PM if not FM – and all his recent politically loaded “economic” statements seem to show his frustration that the goal is slipping out of reach at least until 2029. One charitable excuse is that he has been granting “interviews” to so many known dynastic doormats that finding new anti-Modi things to say is so hard. He ends up saying patently nonsensical things. While anyone can have ambitions and go for it, to see an academic at these levels is a sad sight indeed. He has reduced himself to a meme, caricature, and joke. That is why I used the term “disease”.Let us turn to my other option – he is just a symptom of a much wider disease. Here the evidence is very strong too. Wokeism, as we all know well, is a disease. The West at least the English-speaking parts, seems to suffer from it without a cure in sight. And Rajan is just one of the many symptoms of this disease. We have seen the nasty plagiarism allegations against Harvard President Claudine Gay that don’t seem to die down. Even WaPo and NYT were forced to call for her to quit!  That’s like Pyongyang Times saying maybe Kim should go. Academia in the US has been completely overrun by leftist fringe and wokes and they are imposing their fascist tyranny of the minority, to quote Vivek Ramaswamy) in unprecedented ways. Universities are now full-fledged grooming centres for fringe left, no longer centres of excellence. Companies are even thinking of cutting back on hiring from such swamps. Real academics and faculty are too scared even to speak – for fear of losing their jobs, careers and worse.What has Rajan got to do with it? Well, the point is, given the substantial control fascist left woke Gestapo and the deep state exercise over academia, their ability to make or mar careers, cancel anyone that crosses them or reward the loyal with lucrative gigs and positions, many Indian academics (along with American or others) crawl when asked to bow. Why not board the gravy train instead of being run over by it or left on the platform? That too given your talents and skills, you are not likely to discover a cure for cancer or the next Lithium battery. When the best you can manage is another article on gender intersection or some such nonsense in pseudo-science?That was a hint! Two things you must know about this gang of academics that have been more woke than Pelosi or AOC. One is almost without exception they are from the pseudo-science faculties – not real science. Yes, we are talking sociology, politics “science”, economics etc.  You can’t be a Marxist physicist or Communist Endocrinologist, but you can very well be a radical leftist political “science” professor. Most are.The second and more relevant to India is, that practically all of them are from the upper classes of Indian society. You can do an informal caste census as Rahul Gandhi demands (even in meetings with journalists!). Next time you come across some West-based Desi academic spouting anti-Modi or anti-Hindu hate, wear their agnosticism or rationalism on their sleeves or brown-nosing themselves at dacoit dynastic rears, just check the caste. You will agree.Just as Claudine Gay types exploited the DEI and other such affirmative action moves to land lucrative jobs when their track record would not have justified it by any logical means, these Indian academics have cornered their gigs and positions by exploiting the “let’s get more POC and not be so WASPy” trend among US/UK colleges and universities that started sometime in the 80s. Before that, you had to be exceptionally brilliant even to step in and break the glass barrier. With the opening of the floodgates, a lot of mediocre talent has swept in. They would not have stood the slightest chance in the 60s or even 70s. Having secured them, now they need to hold their positions, climb the ladder and keep the gravy train going. The best and easiest way, of course, is to sing the woke tunes and not miss a beat. If Maoist comrade Kavita Krishnan can declare her pronouns, why can’t some US-based desi academic spout woke nonsense? All that is fine, but what’s the link to India? The connection to Indian and Indian politics is that woke left obedience to Islamist jihadist ideologies and priorities is absolute and non-negotiable. That makes Modi and BJP public enemy No.1. Given substantial funding of these varsities by Qatar etc, this makes eminent financial sense too. India’s Stalinist left has convinced their woke pals in the USA (and West) that bringing the dynasty back to power with remote control firmly in their hands is important. Therefore, the global woke left ecosystem has now become key facilitators and force multipliers in the Stalinist anti-Hindu pogrom of the Indian left. I mentioned the topic of caste. That brings us to an additional point that will explain the virulent woke hysteria, sickening dynastic sycophancy, anti-Hinduism cleverly dressed up as anti-Hindutva (that trick almost worked with Jews/Zionism but see below) by the likes of Shruti Kapila, Ananya Vajpayee, Salil Tripathi, Rajan, Basu, Priyamvada Gopal and the likes. There are dozens if not hundreds more. As I mentioned earlier, many are likely beneficiaries of West’s attempts to be more inclusive. But the genuine Indian subaltern groups have now woken up to a very simple fact – most of the lucrative gigs that followed from such “let us be nice to black, brown, yellow and other POC” have been cornered by the upper caste Indian elites. They are now demanding a share of the pie. And the pie is shrinking. If Trump returns, it will get worse.Again, what is the best way to keep riding the gravy train? Be “woker than the wokes”, attack India, BJP, and Hindus non-stop, follow the deep state party line on Ukraine, Putin, Gaza or whatever, and sing the praise of Rahul Gandhi because that is what the Indian left demands. If not, they will start talking about “privileged birth” and cast evil eyes on your nice cushy gig. They are essentially taking out an insurance policy – one where there is not only no premiums to be paid, but it is more dollars in your bank account. Add Soros, Ford and Omidyar types to the mix, you see the point even more clearly.Do you follow why I say symptom of a much wider disease? Rajans may come or go one day but the disease remains.Now, what is the cure? The Jewish lobby has already found their most potent cure – just cut off the funds. It is producing results. A lot of the leftist academics have started crawling, walking back on naked antisemitism, and issuing holy statements drafted by costly PR agencies. Some, like Gay, are holding out, backed as they are by powerful forces including likes of Obama.Unfortunately, this cure is not available to Hindus simply because we don’t have anywhere near that financial clout. We are lambs for the slaughter.We need to find other medicines. But first we must know the disease. And stay clear eyed. Or in other words, be woke.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"25 December, 2023 ","According to The Hindu, democracy has died yet again after the passage of the Telecom Bill. Why? Because it won’t allow journalists to lie...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/telecommunication-bill-the-hindu-leftist-criticism-journalists/,"The English media has yet again failed to provide an accurate assessment of an important legislation. As is their wont, they have fallen back on archaic arguments expecting the people to lap them up. The people have done well to ignore them.Bharat’s Parliament approved the Telecommunications Bill, 2023 in the recently concluded winter session. This act will now replace three archaic laws from the years 1885, 1933, and 1950. You read the years right. They are not a typo. Up until now, we were still governed by laws passed in 1885 too!  According to the English media, democracy is either in danger in India or has already died in India. Any small action (such as waking up in the morning) by any member of the Modi government causes the death of democracy in India. The passing of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 was no exception. The usual suspects went berserk with their headlines. If you take a look at the collage below, it is clear that these media editors are still driven by archaic language from the year 1885.However, the reasons they have given this time as a justification for their archaic rants will blow your mind. A good summary of their rants was provided by The Hindu. Wanting to stand out from the crowd, The Hindu published a detailed article under the section “FAQ” with an innocent headline – “Will new telecom bill streamline the sector?”. And to make life easy for us, they summarized the reason why all English media editors have yet again declared the death of democracy in India. First, the Telecommunications Act, 2023 is draconian. Why? Because – wait for it – it DOES NOT allow users to furnish false particulars while obtaining telecom services. The largest group that is impacted by this draconian provision is the journalists. I am not saying it – The Hindu has graciously told us the same. India is perhaps the only country in the world where democracy dies a thousand deaths every day because of laws that don’t allow people to lie, cheat and fabricate. And since journalists have descended from a different universe, they reserve all rights to “furnish false particulars” under the garb of doing their job. I often wonder if these people even read what they write! The “draconian” bill apparently also provides for “legal architecture for mass surveillance and internet shutdowns”. Notice the use of complicated language such as “legal architecture” just to sound highly intellectual! What “mass surveillance” are we talking about here? According to The Hindu’s own article, we are looking at the “controversy surrounding Pegasus targetting 300 mobile phone numbers…”. First of all, the Pegasus story has turned out to be a fake one. Assuming it is true – we are looking at a whopping 300 phone numbers in a population of 140 crores! Second of all, the government has no role in private software being used for “illegal surveillance”, so it is best left to your imagination what “mass surveillance” The Hindu and their ilk are talking about. Their arguments on the Internet Shutdown are even more nauseating. While The Hindu’s article focussed only on the Internet shutdowns in Manipur and J&K, their soul sister, The Wire, went ahead and told us that India already has the highest number of Internet shutdowns in the world, and additionally referred to Rajasthan and Odisha too. Well, guess what? When it comes to maintaining law and order, governments all over the world have extraordinary powers to ensure peace. Bill or no bill, state and central governments already have the power to order Internet Shutdowns in the interest of public safety, whether you like it or not. Going by the administrative scale of India’s area and population, what we have seen are minuscule shutdowns focussed on small areas (except for Manipur and J&K). External Affairs minister, S. Jaishankar summarized the situation aptly, in his inimitable style – “Now, if you’ve reached the stage where you say an internet cut is more dangerous than the loss of human lives, then what can I say?”He is right. These people do not value human life. They just want to encourage more violence under the garb of freedom of speech and fundamental rights. These people speak as if the internet has never been used for destructive purposes and feign shock when told otherwise. At one stage, it looks like these people realise that their arguments are not being understood by normal folks. So they come up with a stunning argument to create scare amongst people – sample this snippet from The Wire. First of all, they make it sound like a KYC document is equivalent to you writing your property in the name of WhatsApp! Second and most importantly, at no place is it told that KYC is needed for WhatsApp or similar applications. The ministry has even removed the references to OTT applications from this act because they are covered in the IT Act, of 2000. Again, if the government wants to ban or control any apk, OTT or otherwise, it doesn’t need this particular Telecommunication Act! There are enough laws that give it leeway to take such actions. If anything, this Act brings in much-needed structural changes to how the industry is governed. Certain key demands of the industry and citizens have been incorporated into the Act, thus making it easier for the industry to flourish. Significant amongst such provisions are spectrum auctions for telecom but allocations for satellite communications; the mandate of Do Not Disturb to help us from spam and scam calls; ease of deploying telecom infrastructure on private properties etc. The English media has yet again failed to provide an accurate assessment of an important legislation. As is their wont, they have fallen back on archaic arguments expecting the people to lap them up.

"22 December, 2023 ",Delhi Police’s bizarre argument in an attempt to shield Rahul Gandhi after he revealed identity of minor victim leaves many shocked: How they are...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/delhi-polices-argument-shield-rahul-gandhi-revealed-identity-of-minor-victim-delhi-crematorium-rape-murder/,"Essentially, the Delhi Police told the court that there was no evidence to prove that the 9-year-old Dalit girl was raped and murdered, and since the original crime has not been proved, Rahul Gandhi committed no crime by revealing the identity of the minor victim by publicly revealing the identity of her family. On 22nd December 2023, Rahul Gandhi gave an undertaking to the court agreeing to delete his tweet where he had revealed the identity of a minor victim in his attempt to politicise the 2021 Delhi rape and murder case. In August 2021, a 9-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped and murdered inside a crematorium. Days after the news, Rahul Gandhi had visited the parents of the victim. Thereafter, the Congress leader and his party published pictures and videos revealing the identity of the family of the victim. After the tweet by Rahul Gandhi, NCPCR took cognisance of the offence committed and wrote to social media platforms to take the tweet down. The NCPCR informed Twitter that Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 prohibits the disclosure of the identity of a minor in any form of media and Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012 also stated that no information or photo of a minor should be published in any form of media that revealed the identity of the minor. According to the complaint, the tweets put out by Rahul Gandhi shared certain personal details about the victim violating Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012, and Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act,2015. Hence, the NCPCR asked Twitter to remove the tweets put out by Rahul Gandhi as it was a deprivation and a violation of child rights.Thereafter, Rahul Gandhi’s tweet had been restricted in India, while in the rest of the world, his tweet was visible. The current case in the Delhi High Court stems from a plea moved by Makarand Suresh Mhadlekar where he pleaded that the tweet by Rahul Gandhi violated provisions of the JJ Act and POCSO Act. While it may seem like Rahul Gandhi was merely following the law by agreeing to take his Tweet down, the truth is far from it. The High Court bench had essentially urged Rahul Gandhi to delete the tweet revealing the identity of the minor victim as it said it did not want to pass a judicial order against him. Essentially, the court told Rahul Gandhi that unless he deletes his tweet, the court will pass an order forcing him to comply. It was after this that Rahul Gandhi submitted an undertaking, agreeing to remove posts where he revealed the identity of the minor victim. The Delhi High Court further instructed the Delhi Police to file a status report in the matter of filing an FIR against Rahul Gandhi in the next 4 weeks and posted the matter for 24th of January 2024. While the High Court instructed the Delhi Police to file a status report, the conduct of the police and the arguments it presented in court were nothing short of bizarre. During the hearing, the Delhi Police on Thursday made arguments that left many shell-shocked. The arguments aimed to shield Rahul Gandhi and absolve him of culpability after he revealed the identity of a minor victim. In court, the counsel for Delhi Police in the matter, Santosh Kumar Tripathi, told the court that the investigation against Rahul Gandhi was underway and there was “a lot of complexity in the matter”. Further, the Delhi Police shockingly informed the High Court that the victim was not raped or murdered but died due to electrocution. If this assertion by the Delhi Police was not shocking enough, the Delhi Police went a step further. When asked about the status of the investigation against Rahul Gandhi and the filing of the FIR, the Delhi Police asserted that “unless the first part is proved, which is the main crime, subsequent circulation of anything on Twitter is not a crime. The purpose of Delhi Police is not to scandalise anyone”. Essentially, the Delhi Police told the court that there was no evidence to prove that the 9-year-old Dalit girl was raped and murdered, and since the original crime has not been proved, Rahul Gandhi committed no crime by revealing the identity of the minor victim by publicly revealing the identity of her family. Let us keep in mind here that the Delhi Cantonment case of this alleged rape and murder was a wildly politicised one. After the news of the alleged crime broke, Rahul Gandhi travelled to meet the victim’s parents, there were several protests, and the usual tropes about a “priest” raping and killing a Dalit child were furthered to create disaffection against the Hindu community at large by furthering the caste narrative. In 2021, the Delhi Police said that the child did not die of electrocution as claimed by the accused, but was raped and murdered. In the chargesheet, relying largely on the disclosure statements by the accused, the Delhi Police named 55-year-old Radhey Shyam, the priest of the crematorium in South-West Delhi, and other employees – Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmad and Laxmi Narayan, as the accused. The chargesheet claimed that there was sufficient evidence against them.As per its press release in 2021, the Delhi Police gathered scientific and technical evidence apart from recording testimonies of witnesses before filing its charge sheet. Assistance was taken from the Forensic Science Laboratory, Rohini as well as Delhi Police’s forensic experts on biology and odontology. Forensic psychologists were also engaged during the interrogation of the accused, the Delhi Police stated. Now, 2.5 years after a 400 page chargesheet was filed in the case claiming that there was sufficient evidence against the 4 accused, the Delhi Police, in a case related to Rahul Gandhi, stated in court yesterday that they had reached the conclusion that there was no rape and murder in the case. While this revelation was shocking enough, what was far more astounding was the argument that the Delhi Police took, based on this revelation, to shield Rahul Gandhi. In court, the Delhi Police claimed that since they had concluded that there was no forensic evidence to prove rape and murder, Rahul Gandhi had broken no laws by revealing the victim’s identity. The Delhi Police’s argument that because 2.5 years after the FIR was filed, they have concluded that no rape or murder took place, Rahul Gandhi had not broken any law by revealing the identity of the minor victim is legally an unsound opinion. The law has been established as far as the identity of the minor victim is concerned and it has nothing to do with the eventual conviction or acquittal of the accused. This is to say that the eventual outcome of the case in the court of law has no bearing on whether the identity of the minor victim can be revealed or not. Regardless of the outcome, revealing the identity is in contravention of the law. If the Delhi Police’s argument is to be accepted, then it would mean that till the case reaches its conclusion, which may take years, any individual including the media is free to circulate the identity of the minor victim. This would be against natural justice and the very purpose for which these laws against the revelation of identity have been put in place. The reason the law prohibits the circulation of the identity of a minor victim, regardless of the acquittal or conviction, is because it stigmatises the minor victim. The stigma attached to their identity being revealed is not dependent on the conclusion of the case or evidence of the crime. There are several laws, provisions and guidelines that prove that the Delhi Police’s position in the case of Rahul Gandhi is legally unsound. Prohibition on disclosure of the identity of children.(1) No report in any newspaper, magazine, news sheet or audio-visual media or other forms of communication regarding any inquiry or investigation or judicial procedure, shall disclose the name, address school or any other particular, which may lead to the identification of a child in conflict with the law or a child in need of care and protection or a child victim or witness of a crime, involved in such matter, under any other law for the time being in force, nor shall the picture of any such child be published: Provided that for reasons to be recorded i.n writing, the Board or Committee, as the case may be, holding the inquiry may permit such disclosure, if in its opinion such disclosure is in the best interest of the child.(2) The Police shall not disclose any record of the child for the purpose of character certificate or otherwise in cases where the case has been closed or disposed of.(3) Any person contravening the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or fine which may extend to two lakh rupees or both.”Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 makes it amply clear that under no circumstances would the identity of a minor victim or even a minor witness of a crime, will be revealed. The law says that no detail that could lead to the identification of the minor victim or witness shall be published in any medium – this would include the identity of the parents of the victim – a detail which was publicised by Rahul Gandhi in the given case. The law provides that contravention of this act would attract a jail sentence of up to 6 months. (1) No person shall make any report or present comments on any child from any form of media or studio or photographic facilities without having complete and authentic information, which may have the effect of lowering his reputation or infringing upon his privacy.(2) No reports in any media shall disclose, the identity of a child including his name, address, photograph, family details, school, neighbourhood or any other particulars which may lead to disclosure of the identity of the child: Provided that for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Special Court, competent to try the case under the Act, may permit such disclosure, if in its opinion such disclosure is in the interest of the child.(3) The publisher or owner of the media or studio or photographic facilities shall be jointly and severally liable for the acts and omissions of his employee.(4) Any person who contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall be liable to be punished with imprisonment of either description for a period which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to one year or with fine or with both.”Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2021 also makes it clear that any circulation of identifiable information, which includes the family details of the minor victim, is punishable by no less than 6 months in jail, which could extend up to 1 year. While this rule mentions the media, it also extends to individuals such as Rahul Gandhi. “Whoever prints or publishes the name or any matter which may make known the identity of any person against whom an offence under section 376. section 376A, section 376B, section 376C or section 376D is alleged or found to have been committed (hereafter in this section referred to as the victim) shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.”Section 228A of the IPC talks about the illegality of disclosing the identity of a victim of sexual assault. While this law is not specifically made for minor victims, it extends to all victims of sexual assault, including minors. The Nipun Saxena v. Union of India case is set strict guidelines to be followed regarding the identity of victims of sexual assault. These guidelines are widely accepted as the standard in such cases. The court in this case set out: 1. No person can print or publish in print, electronic, social media, etc. the name of the victim or even in a remote manner disclose any facts which can lead to the victim being identified and which should make her identity known to the public at large.2. In cases where the victim is dead or of unsound mind the name of the victim or her identity should not be disclosed even under the authorization of the next of kin, unless circumstances justifying the disclosure of her identity exist, which shall be decided by the competent authority, which at present is the Sessions Judge.In the Nipun Saxena case, the court makes it clear further that no individual can disclose the identity of the rape victim or any information that can lead to her identity being known to the public at large, which is exactly what Rahul Gandhi did. In none of these laws or precedents, does the conclusion of the case have any bearing, which is to say, in none of these laws or precedents does it say that an individual is permitted to disclose the identity of the victim and it would not be considered a crime if eventually, the accused are acquitted. It is, therefore, shocking that the Delhi Police would in court make such an argument that is not supported by the established law of the land. The only conclusion which explains the Delhi Police and its advocate’s argument is that this was a shoddy attempt at shielding Rahul Gandhi from the repercussions of his action since it is evident that he did not want a judicial order to this effect on his record. There are several questions that arise from the conduct of the Delhi Police and its counsel in the Rahul Gandhi matter. These questions have bewildered even those in the know of the case and close to the investigation against Rahul Gandhi. A senior advocate on the condition of anonymity claimed that the Delhi Police’s argument in court had shocked everyone and it made no legal sense. “It would appear that the case is being botched up either way to shield Rahul Gandhi”, he said. Another close to MHA, under whom the Delhi Police falls, said that they would be looking into the matter and ensuring that the investigation is not being compromised for political reasons.

"21 December, 2023 ",The erosion of democratic decorum: Opposition’s unruly conduct in Parliament threatens the integrity of the democratic process,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/opposition-unruly-conduct-parliament-integrity-democratic-process/,"Opposition decided to engage in mockery, sloganeering and unruly behaviour that cast a dark shadow on the democratic ideals that define our great nation.The security breach in the Lok Sabha on 13th December 2023 was a highly concerning event, especially on the anniversary of the deadly 2001 parliament attack. While the security breach is under investigation, the opposition’s response to it has lacked decorum and has raised serious apprehensions about the sanctity of the democratic process.In the aftermath, the opposition followed the path of slogan-shouting, hooliganism and blatant disregard for the established parliamentary norms. Sadly, the opposition leaders brought placards to the House even though they promised not to do so in the meeting with Speaker Om Birla.There is no doubt that the opposition plays a vital role in the democratic setup. The opposition serves as a necessary check on the ruling party, and ensures that the decisions made by the central government undergo scrutiny. However, how the opposition chose to behave in the House following the security breach raises grave concerns about the integrity of the parliamentary proceedings.To maintain the decorum of the House, the Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairperson had to suspend over 140 Members of the Parliament from both Houses. In a democracy, constructive debates are the bedrock of informed governance. Only through the debates in the House do the proposed bills get subjected to the much-needed examination. The debates and proposed amendments help formulate robust and comprehensive laws that benefit all sections of society. However, it is regrettable that the recent events in both Houses showcased a blatant disregard for the democratic process as the opposition continued to obstruct the functioning of the parliament.Notably, Lok Sabha passed significant bills such as Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Sakshhya (Second) Bill 2023, and The Telecommunications Bill, 2023 on 20th December 2023. Sadly, a significant portion of the opposition was missing from the House as they were suspended due to the disruptive behaviour. The ruling party in the House faced a difficult choice. Still, they had no option but to proceed without the participation of the opposition leaders to ensure the legislative process continued.In the last 9.5 years since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took charge at the Centre, the country has progressed in every section. The government’s dedication towards nation-building and its unwavering commitment to a better future for the citizens is commendable. However, in stark contrast, the opposition has persistently attempted to impede these efforts. Their behaviour raises serious questions about their priorities and allegiance to the welfare of the people of Bharat.Furthermore, the unwarranted mocking of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar by TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee added an even more troubling dimension to the conduct of the opposition. His behaviour undermined the dignity of the parliamentary proceedings and set a dangerous path for the future. The Vice President, as the Chair of the Rajya Sabha, symbolises the highest level of parliamentary authority, and such attempts to belittle the office are a direct assault on the democratic principles of the country. The matter was so concerning that the President of India had to step in and express her dismay over the unwarranted mockery of the Vice President. Bharat is heading towards the Lok Sabha Elections 2024. The voters are now at a critical decision-making juncture. It is essential to examine the conduct of the political parties and their representatives, especially in times of crisis. Hooliganism, slogan-shouting, and an utter lack of decorum have no place in the esteemed halls of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.Undoubtedly, the events of 13th December 2023 highlighted a concerning lapse in security. However, instead of supporting the security agencies and the government to weed out the loopholes, the opposition decided to engage in mockery, sloganeering and unruly behaviour that cast a dark shadow on the democratic ideals that define our great nation. Voters must meticulously evaluate the conduct of elected representatives. The representatives in the Parliament must be held accountable.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"26 December, 2023 ","Alt News’ Mohammed Zubair spreads fake claims that Anju Bobby George joined BJP, yet to delete after multiple fact-checks",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/alt-news-md-zubair-spreads-fake-news-anju-bobby-george-yest-to-delete-after-multiple-fact-checks/,"Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Murlaeedharan also refuted the claims that Anju joined the BJP. Speaking to the Indian Express then, he had said he has had a long association with Anju and her husband, Robert Bobby George and Anju was at the event just to meet him.On 25th December, Alt News’ co-founder out-on-bail Mohammed Zubair targetted former athlete Anju Bobby George for praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In a social media post, he claimed that mainstream media reports mentioned that she praised PM Modi but did not mention that she joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019. In the post, he wrote, “ANI forgot to mention that BJP member Anju George joined the party in 2019” and shared two screenshots from ANI. One from 23rd December, where ANI shared a video of Anju praising PM Modi, and the second from July 2019, where ANI mistakenly claimed Anju joined the BJP.Zubair, who claims to be the ‘messiah’ of fact-checking, failed to fact-check if Anju joined the BJP. On 6th July, Anju Bobby George attended an event where BJP Karnataka President BS Yeddyurappa was present. In a post on X (then-Twitter), ANI wrote, “Anju Bobby George, India’s first athletics medallist at the World Championship, joins BJP in the presence of Karnataka BJP President BS Yeddyurappa.”However, the report was incorrect, and Anju refuted the claims that she had no political aspirations. Speaking to the media, she said, “I had gone there just to meet the minister (V Muraleedharan), a family friend. When the BJP leaders saw me standing near the stage, they called me on stage and greeted me with the flag. They did not even know that I was present at the function. Sports is my party, and I have no intention of joining any party.”Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Murlaeedharan also refuted the claims that Anju joined the BJP. Speaking to the Indian Express, he said he has had a long association with Anju and her husband, Robert Bobby George. When he went to a party programme in Bengaluru, Anju called and asked to meet, to which he agreed. “When she came to the programme where I was taking part, the event was about to begin. So I invited her to the dais, as she is an internationally acclaimed athlete.”Notably, a statement by Karnataka BJP media convener S Shantaram also created confusion in the matter as he slammed her for saying that she did not join the party. He had said, “She came on stage, took the party flag & our state President announced she joined the BJP. Don’t know why she changed stand. Doesn’t she know the meaning of taking the flag on stage from the president?” Later, he told BOOM there was some miscommunication as she came to the dias and accepted the flag. However, when BOOM contacted Anju, she categorically refuted the claims that she had joined the BJP and clarified that she only went to meet the minister.Interestingly, Zubair, according to the left liberals, who is the “poster boy” of fact-checking, did not correct his fake post even after multiple fact-checks. Replying to Zubair, Ankur Singh wrote, “Why are you spreading Fake News even after four years? She never joined the BJP. Anju and BJP both clarified on the same day. There were several fact checks too. But why will you show the truth?”Why are you spreading Fake News even after 4 years?She never joined BJP. Anju and BJP both had clarified the same day.There were several fact checks too. But why will you show the truth? pic.twitter.com/5RDpBne1f3In a post, X user Mr Sinha fact-checked Zubair and wrote, “Anju Bobby George never joined BJP, it was cleared in 2019 itself and yet this guy who calls every other person fake news peddler & himself a fact checker sharing fake news…”Anju Bobby George never joined BJP, it was cleared in 2019 itself and yet this guy who calls every other person fake news peddler & himself a fact checker sharing fake news… pic.twitter.com/xPuDZpvTFnThe most interesting thing is that one of Zubair’s favourite media houses, Maktoob Media, also fact-checked whether Anju joined the BJP or not 2019 and came to the conclusion that the reports were false.

"21 December, 2023 ","‘Fact-Checker’ Md Zubair spreads fake news after Sanjay Singh wins election to become WFI president, claims he was ‘appointed’ by BJP",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-checker-md-zubair-spreads-fake-news-that-sanjay-singh-was-appointed-as-wfi-president-by-bjp/,"BJP or any political party, or even the government, can’t appoint the WFI president, or any head of any sporting federation in the country. Any interference in running sporting bodies results in the suspension of such a body by respective parent global body. The protesting wrestlers led by Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia, and Vinesh Phogat faced a massive setback after former Commonwealth Games Gold medallist Anita Sheoran lost the election for the post of the president of the Wrestling Federations of India (WFI). Sheoran, who was supported by the protesting wrestlers, was defeated by Sanjay Singh, who is close to former president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.Unhappy with the results of the election, Sakshi Malik has announced that she is retiring from the sport because Sanjay Singh is allegedly a business partner of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. She said in a press conference, “If somebody like Sanjay Singh, who is a business partner and friend of Brij Bhushan Singh is elected as the new president, I am quitting wrestling.”As Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is a BJP MP, left-liberals are already attacking the BJP over Sanjay Singh becoming the new WFI president. However, ‘fact-checker’ and Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair went ahead, claiming that Sanjay Singh was appointed to the sports body by BJP, and he was not elected.Quoting an ANI tweet showing Sakshi Malik breaking while exiting the press conference, Md Zubair tweeted, “Tweet like BJP: 60+ crore Indian Women insulted by BJP by appointing Former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s close Aid as the new president of Wrestling Federation of India.”While he was trying to take on BJP’s claim that the opposition insulted the Jat community by doing a mimicry on Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, he resorted to using false claims in the tweet. Zubair claimed that the BJP appointed Sharan Singh as the new president of Wrestling Federation of India. He said that Sanjay Singh is a close aide of former WFI chief and sexual harassment accused Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, trying to imply that it should disqualify him from the post.It is obvious that BJP or any political party, or even the government, can’t appoint the WFI president, or any head of any sporting federation in the country. Any interference in running sporting bodies, including the selection of officials, results in the suspension of such a body by the parent global body. In fact, WFI is already suspended by United World Wrestling for not holding the elections on time, and now that suspension is expected to be lifted.Sanjay Singh has been elected as the new WFI president, he was not ‘appointed’ to the post as alleged by Islamist propagandist Zubair. The election is held as per Model Election Guidelines of the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sport. The details of how elections are conducted as mentioned in the WFI constitution.As per Article IV of the constitution, All State Wrestling Associations and Union Territory Wrestling Associations are entitled to send 2 Representatives to the General Council. Each Representative have one vote.Accordingly, the elections for 15 posts of the WFI including the president were held in Delhi on 21st December. Besides president, elections were held for the posts of a senior vice-president, four vice-presidents, a secretary general, a treasurer, two joint secretaries and five executive members. Out of a total of 47 votes, Sanjay Singh got 40 votes, while Anita Sheoran received only 7 votes. Reportedly, candidates in Brish Bhushan’s camp won 13 out of the 15 positions. Therefore, it can’t be even claimed that federations in BJP-ruled states voted for Singh, because there are more than 7 states where non-BJP parties are in power. This clearly shows that a majority of the members voted for Singh, while the support for Sheoran, supported by protesting wrestlers, is very low.However, these facts do not bother ‘fact-checker’ Zubair to claim that Sanjay Singh has been appointed as WFI president by the BJP.The election of a new president means that the suspension of WFI by the global wrestling body United World Wrestling will be lifted. UWW had suspended WFI for failing to hold elections before the August deadline, and Indians wrestlers have been competing as neutral athletes at international events after that. WFI elections were originally scheduled for July, before the deadline, but it was deferred multiple times due to court cases.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.""on 17th and 18th December, a video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni went viral on social media. As per the subtitles in the video, she was seen saying that Islam is not compatible with European values and culture. Islam is being perpetrated (in Italy) through Saudi Arabia’s funding and Saudi Arabia has Sharia law. Meloni further says that the Sharia law is not compatible with Europian values and culture. The whole of Europe is being Islamised.There is no similarity between our culture and Islam.Islam is being spread by Saudi in Italy.There is Sharia law in Saudi, which we will not allow to be implemented in Italy.: Georgia Meloni, PM, Italy pic.twitter.com/uCqYhpodBuThe same alleged statement was reported by a number of media houses, mostly Indian.

A number of Indian media houses including WION, Hindustan Times, Mint, NDTV, and Times Now reported the same claims. NDTV used a X post embed of a handle named Geopolitical Kid and wrote that Meloni’s statement was given during the political event organised by her party. However, Meloni’s statement regarding Islam’s alleged incompatibility wasn’t found in any international publications in the last 24-hour window. Radio Genoa, a popular handle on X, seemed to have first posted the video. Italian PM Giorgia Meloni: “I believe that there is a problem of compatibility between Islamic culture and the values ​​and rights of our civilization. The Islamic cultural centers in Italy are financed by Saudi Arabia where Sharia is in force. In Europe there is a very… pic.twitter.com/wEn8Fl4JC2However, Radio Genoa has not cited a time frame, and has not written that Meloni’s statement was recent. Upon searching with the keywords and comparing it with Meloni’s video clip going viral, we found that the original video was posted on YouTube back in 2018. The video was posted by the YouTube channel alanews in 2018. The original video can be seen here. In the video, Meloni is seen saying, “Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.”In that video, Meloni was referring to a previous statement by another conservative leader Matteo Salvini. Salvini, referring to the Cologne mass sexual attacks and Berlin terrorist attack, had said that Islam is incompatible with European values. Salvni is a leader of Italy’s Lega Nord party. Conclusion: While the viral video of Giorgia Meloni is mostly correct in rough translation, the video, or the statement, are not recent. They are from 5 years ago, and not from the recent political event organised by Meloni’s party. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did Pakistani caretaker PM confirm that unknown men poisoned Dawood Ibrahim? Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-check-pakistani-caretaker-pm-dawood-ibrahim-death-confirmation/,"Dawood Ibrahim was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. On Monday (18th December), social media was abuzz with rumours of the death of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, who has been hiding in Pakistan for decades. As per the rumours, Ibrahim was poisoned by an unknown person, and he was rushed to hospital. Some posts on social media claimed he was critical, while others claimed that he died. The rumours began spreading on Sunday (17th December) after Pakistan’s internet went down.Amid the rumours, an alleged screenshot of caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar Ul Haq Kakar, went viral on social media with claims that the said post confirmed the death of Ibrahim. The post read, “The Messiah of humanity, dear to every Pakistani heart, our beloved His Excellency Dawood Ibrahim passed away due to poisoned by unknown. He breathed his last in a hospital in Karachi. May Allah grant him the highest position in Jannat. Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.”However, when OpIndia investigated the screenshot and the official handle of the Pakistani PM, we found that there was no such tweet. Furthermore, the handle used in the screenshot was anwaar_kakkar, while the real ID of the Pakistani PM is anwaar_kakar. There is a handle called anwaar_kakkar, but that is a fan account of PM Kakar, and there was no such tweet either. It was evident that someone artificially created the post by adding text and a Grey Verified Check Mark on the fan account.Pakistani journalists also fuelled the rumours. In a recent episode of Bheja Fry, Pakistani journalist Aarzoo Kazmi talked about the rumours surrounding the poisoning of Dawood Ibrahim and his critical health in the hospital. She highlighted the fact that there was an internet shutdown in the country and emphasised that something was happening in Pakistan. She also talked about the rumours of Dawood Ibrahim’s poisoning and critical health. While she fanned the rumours, the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed.As per Aaj Tak, Ibrahim was indeed admitted to the hospital two days back. It is unclear what was the reason, but several reports talked about the rumours of him being poisoned.Though the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed, it was indeed a fact that internet services faced a massive crackdown in Pakistan on 17th December. Social media services and search engines stopped working without any prior notice. No one could access social media platforms like X, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and the Google search engine was down. While it was rumoured that the crackdown was because of the poisoning of Ibrahim, in reality, it appeared that the Pakistani government shut down the internet to limit the access and circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer in Mumbai. It is believed that he now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.While Ibrahim’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refused to accept his presence in the country.OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 December, 2023 ",HC rejects India Today’s plea against govt order asking them to run apology scroll for showing liquor ads: Details,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/delhi-high-court-tv-today-mib-order-apology-scrolls-liquor-ads/,"The MIB ordered TV Today to run an apology scroll at the bottom of the monitor four times a day between 9 AM and 9 PM for three straight days for broadcasting advertisements for 100 Pipers Music CDs and All Seasons Club Soda on its news channels.The Delhi High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by TV Today Network (which runs news channels Aaj Tak and India Today among others) challenging a Central Government order asking the media network to run apologies scrolls for broadcasting liquor commercials on its news channels.Justice Subramonium Prasad dismissed the petition, stating that TV Today had broken Rule 7 (Advertising Code) of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994, by displaying the ‘100 Pipers’ logo while advertising 100 Pipers Music CDs.“The display of the logo of ‘100 Pipers’ would thus appear to be in contravention of that Rule. Since the provisions of Rule 7 have not been complied with, the contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that they had proceeded in good faith based on the CBFC [Central Board of Film Certification] certificate which was submitted by the advertiser cannot be accepted as the Rules do not permit the broadcaster to independently ascertain the veracity of the clip that is provided by the advertiser,” the Court observed.As per Rule 7(1)(2)(viii)(A) of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994, “Advertising carried in the cable service shall be so designed as to conform to the laws of the country and should not offend morality, decency and religious susceptibilities of the subscribers.” Further, the law does not allow any advertisement that promotes directly or indirectly the production, sale, or consumption of cigarettes, tobacco products, wine, alcohol, liquor, or other intoxicants (subject to conditions). Concerning the running of the ‘All Seasons Club Soda’ advertisement, the Court determined that it was not even certified by the CBFC. The order was issued after TV Today filed a petition with the High Court challenging a Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) order dated 14th June 2022.The MIB ordered TV Today to run an apology scroll at the bottom of the monitor four times a day between 9 AM and 9 PM for three straight days for broadcasting advertisements for 100 Pipers Music CDs and All Seasons Club Soda on its news channels.TV Today maintained that, in the case of the ‘100 Pipers’ broadcast, the clip was aired based on the CBFC certificate, which was provided by the advertiser.Regarding the ‘All Seasons Club Soda’ broadcast, it was stated that the brand name ‘All Seasons’ is commonly used by a variety of products other than a liquor brand.The counsel maintained that the MIB orders should be overturned because the channel was not supposed to compare the clips provided by the advertiser with those certified by the CBFC before airing them. The media outlet had acted in good faith, the court was informed. Justice Prasad, however, rejected these arguments. “On a perusal of the clip and the screenshots that were produced, it is clearly evident that what was broadcast would not satisfy the well-recognized attributes of surrogate advertising. This clip admittedly was also not certified by CBFC. A visual examination of that clip would lead one to the irresistible conclusion that what was in fact being directly advertised was a prohibited product. The petitioner has thus clearly failed to act with prudence and care insofar as the broadcast of that particular clip is concerned,” the order dated 19th December read. “In view of the above, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the Orders dated 14.06.2022, passed by the Competent Authority, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting,” the High Court concluded.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 December, 2023 ","According to The Hindu, democracy has died yet again after the passage of the Telecom Bill. Why? Because it won’t allow journalists to lie...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/telecommunication-bill-the-hindu-leftist-criticism-journalists/,"The English media has yet again failed to provide an accurate assessment of an important legislation. As is their wont, they have fallen back on archaic arguments expecting the people to lap them up. The people have done well to ignore them.Bharat’s Parliament approved the Telecommunications Bill, 2023 in the recently concluded winter session. This act will now replace three archaic laws from the years 1885, 1933, and 1950. You read the years right. They are not a typo. Up until now, we were still governed by laws passed in 1885 too!  According to the English media, democracy is either in danger in India or has already died in India. Any small action (such as waking up in the morning) by any member of the Modi government causes the death of democracy in India. The passing of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 was no exception. The usual suspects went berserk with their headlines. If you take a look at the collage below, it is clear that these media editors are still driven by archaic language from the year 1885.However, the reasons they have given this time as a justification for their archaic rants will blow your mind. A good summary of their rants was provided by The Hindu. Wanting to stand out from the crowd, The Hindu published a detailed article under the section “FAQ” with an innocent headline – “Will new telecom bill streamline the sector?”. And to make life easy for us, they summarized the reason why all English media editors have yet again declared the death of democracy in India. First, the Telecommunications Act, 2023 is draconian. Why? Because – wait for it – it DOES NOT allow users to furnish false particulars while obtaining telecom services. The largest group that is impacted by this draconian provision is the journalists. I am not saying it – The Hindu has graciously told us the same. India is perhaps the only country in the world where democracy dies a thousand deaths every day because of laws that don’t allow people to lie, cheat and fabricate. And since journalists have descended from a different universe, they reserve all rights to “furnish false particulars” under the garb of doing their job. I often wonder if these people even read what they write! The “draconian” bill apparently also provides for “legal architecture for mass surveillance and internet shutdowns”. Notice the use of complicated language such as “legal architecture” just to sound highly intellectual! What “mass surveillance” are we talking about here? According to The Hindu’s own article, we are looking at the “controversy surrounding Pegasus targetting 300 mobile phone numbers…”. First of all, the Pegasus story has turned out to be a fake one. Assuming it is true – we are looking at a whopping 300 phone numbers in a population of 140 crores! Second of all, the government has no role in private software being used for “illegal surveillance”, so it is best left to your imagination what “mass surveillance” The Hindu and their ilk are talking about. Their arguments on the Internet Shutdown are even more nauseating. While The Hindu’s article focussed only on the Internet shutdowns in Manipur and J&K, their soul sister, The Wire, went ahead and told us that India already has the highest number of Internet shutdowns in the world, and additionally referred to Rajasthan and Odisha too. Well, guess what? When it comes to maintaining law and order, governments all over the world have extraordinary powers to ensure peace. Bill or no bill, state and central governments already have the power to order Internet Shutdowns in the interest of public safety, whether you like it or not. Going by the administrative scale of India’s area and population, what we have seen are minuscule shutdowns focussed on small areas (except for Manipur and J&K). External Affairs minister, S. Jaishankar summarized the situation aptly, in his inimitable style – “Now, if you’ve reached the stage where you say an internet cut is more dangerous than the loss of human lives, then what can I say?”He is right. These people do not value human life. They just want to encourage more violence under the garb of freedom of speech and fundamental rights. These people speak as if the internet has never been used for destructive purposes and feign shock when told otherwise. At one stage, it looks like these people realise that their arguments are not being understood by normal folks. So they come up with a stunning argument to create scare amongst people – sample this snippet from The Wire. First of all, they make it sound like a KYC document is equivalent to you writing your property in the name of WhatsApp! Second and most importantly, at no place is it told that KYC is needed for WhatsApp or similar applications. The ministry has even removed the references to OTT applications from this act because they are covered in the IT Act, of 2000. Again, if the government wants to ban or control any apk, OTT or otherwise, it doesn’t need this particular Telecommunication Act! There are enough laws that give it leeway to take such actions. If anything, this Act brings in much-needed structural changes to how the industry is governed. Certain key demands of the industry and citizens have been incorporated into the Act, thus making it easier for the industry to flourish. Significant amongst such provisions are spectrum auctions for telecom but allocations for satellite communications; the mandate of Do Not Disturb to help us from spam and scam calls; ease of deploying telecom infrastructure on private properties etc. The English media has yet again failed to provide an accurate assessment of an important legislation. As is their wont, they have fallen back on archaic arguments expecting the people to lap them up.

"23 December, 2023 ","Favouritism, allowing harassment of women at the workplace, exploitation: How Left ecosystem shielded author of the book on Rahul Gandhi",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/allegations-of-favouritism-sexual-abuse-serial-lying-how-left-ecosystem-shielded-rahul-gandhi-book-author/,"After Dayashankar Mishra's resignation, several reports citing News 18 employees have accused the author of a book on Rahul Gandhi of after his resignation, many reports citing employees in News18 have accused him of favouritism, castism, sexual abuse, unprofessional behaviour and other allegations.On 22nd November 2023, Dayashankar Mishra resigned from News18. He claimed in his X post that he was forced to resign because he wrote a book on Congress scion Rahul Gandhi. However, after his resignation, many reports citing employees in News18 have accused him of favouritism, casteism, harassment of women at the workplace, unprofessional behaviour and other allegations.Reports on Bhadas4Media have covered many such accounts of these former colleagues of Dayashankar Mishra. Mishra is also accused of compiling his book using multiple reports from various news media outlets. The News18 has also refuted his claims terming them false and misleading.In his X post, Dayashankar Mishra wrote, “I had no idea how difficult it would be to write the truth on Rahul Gandhi. At a time when there is a competition for writing stories and mythology in the ruling class, I thought why would it bother anyone to compile and present the thinking, vision and perseverance of a public thinker? But I was proved wrong. It is our job to write and express. But due to this, suddenly the company’s beats increased. I had the option of getting the book back. Keep working. Shut up. But I chose the book. We chose what is our basic task. Chose to tell the truth. Therefore, first the resignation, then the book.”पहले इस्तीफ़ा, फिर किताब :राहुल गांधी पर सच लिखना क‍ितनी मुश्‍किलें खड़ी करेगा, मुझे बिल्कुल अंदाज़ा नहीं था। ऐसे समय जब सत्‍ताधीशों पर गाथा-पुराण ल‍िखने की होड़ लगी हो, मैंने सोचा था कि एक लोकनीत‍िक व‍िचारक की सोच, दृष्टि और दृढ़ता को संकल‍ित कर प्रस्‍तुत करना क‍िसी को क्‍यों… pic.twitter.com/oEroAWRP1iAfter this post of Dayashankar Mishra, ‘News18 India’ also shared a post on X. In this post, News18 described Dayashankar Mishra’s post as misleading and baseless. In its post, News18 India said that as per the rules of the company, before writing any book or making any kind of contribution outside the organisation, employees have to get permission. This is how it is in all reputed media institutions. But Dayashankar Mishra, as editor of the Hindi website of News18, did not get permission from the organisation to write this book.News18 statement about the false and misleading claims by Mr Dayashankar Mishra: pic.twitter.com/Cuo5Jd5LRbAfter Dayashankar Mishra resigned from News18 Hindi, many of his former colleagues came ahead to share their experiences with the journalist, who for all practical purposes had become a political activist singing an ode to Rahul Gandhi. According to reports in the media, Mishra is accused of unprofessional behaviour, harassment of women at the workplace, favouritism, casteism, and cheating on the employer. They have also accused him of plagiarism in his book ‘Rahul Gandhi: Historic Struggle against Communalism, Disinformation and Dictatorship’.The book is seen as an attempt by the journalist to make inroads to the Congress party rather than his commitment to be a voice of opposition as he claims. He strategically launched the book on 22nd November when the elections were happening in 5 states. However, the book had no impact on the results as the BJP triumphed in the Hindi-speaking states where the former journalist from News18 Hindi was trying to make grounds for Congress.In various reports published on Bhadas4Media, it is claimed that Dayashankar Mishra favoured people from his caste and his relatives while recruiting new candidates in the News18 Hindi’s digital newsroom. Some of them have claimed that he would favour a certain few. Others have claimed that his book is not an original work and hardly any part is written by himself. They claim that he either used old reports from anti-Modi portals like Newslaundry and Alt News as it is or he deployed some of his juniors for this work. While doing so, Dayashankar Mishra also communicated to his seniors in News18 that these junior colleagues were working on some secret project. Therefore, he is also accused of cheating his employer.Besides, the reports also claimed that he would often ask his junior employees to do his household work and never pay serious attention to female colleagues requesting him to constitute a committee to probe their allegations against others under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace rules. Some of them even accused him of harassment at the workplace.As it completes a month to Dayashankar Mishra’s resignation from Network18, it should be noted that despite repeated allegations against him by his former colleagues, no one from the ecosystem of leftist liberal journalists and mainstream media houses has shown the courage to confront him on these issues and ask clarification from him on these allegations. Instead, his book was promoted on various platforms as he was invited to speak about this book on various web portals and their YouTube channels. This should be seen as a systematic attempt to shield a once powerful boss in the newsroom who continuously threatened his colleagues that they might lose their jobs if they went against him. Dayashankar Mishra’s whole episode should therefore be seen as an eye-opener exposing the dark side of the Left ecosystem that turns a blind eye to serious allegations of misconduct against one of their own while blowing trumpet and resorting to exaggeration against their ideological opponents.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On 18th December (Monday), the Times of India commemorated the birth anniversary of Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin describing him as ‘The Man of Steel’. Shared as a Trivia factoid, the post eulogised him with a poster listing key facets of his “leadership”. The portrait depicts him in an all-colour pallet of revolution.You share your #birhday with…The Steel Man – Joseph Stalin. pic.twitter.com/iWdzHF4C5UHere are the bullet points that the media house noted about the Communist Dictator – Further, the caption, “You share your #birhday (sic) with…The Man of Steel – Joseph Stalin”, insinuates that sharing a birthday with the ‘Steel Man’ is some kind of an achievement.Meanwhile, apart from the TOI post, some other users also praised Joseph Stalin on his birth anniversary. CPI(M)’s Puducherry unit praising the Communist dictator wrote, “Comrade Joseph Stalin, born on December 18, 1878, a revolutionary Bolshevik who led the victorious Antifascist war and laid the foundation for a strong working-class state of the planet.

Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.” Should you not also add about the Stalinist purges, the gulags, the famines etc that were the hallmark of his reign of terror? Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labour camps, forced collectivisation, famine and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women.In a century, communist states have killed approximately 100 million people, according to Ilya Somin’s articles. Joseph Stalin’s attempts to collectivise agriculture and production in Russia resulted in the deaths of 6 to 10 million people. Stalin imposed collective agriculture, prohibiting people from cultivating on their own, and imprisoning dissenters in Siberian labour camps. In Russia and Ukraine, millions went hungry, and hundreds of thousands died in prison camps. When Ukrainian production fell short of Stalin’s quota, he punished them even more by taking away everything they had. In Ukraine, Stalin’s forced famine is termed ‘Holodomor’ by joining the words for hunger (holod) and mor (extermination or mass-murder).Stalin’s atrocities were not restricted to the Soviet famine; he also carried out the ‘Great Purge,’ in which everyone he disapproved of was imprisoned, tortured, or executed. No one was spared, even wealthy peasants, politicians, military men, and ethnic minorities. The Purge alone is thought to have killed over 1.2 million people.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"27 December, 2023 ",‘Harappan civilisation is 7000 to 8000 years old’: Scientists studying DNA samples from Rakhigarhi site find,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/harappan-civilisation-is-7000-8000-years-old-scientists-studying-dna-samples-from-rakhigarhi-site-find/,"Shirwalkar further elaborated, ""Human ‘DNA’ has remained the same for 8,000 years which we have found during our research. When human traps were found here, they were thoroughly tested. Scientists have drawn conclusions based on this. A large burial ground was found here and it had human traps as well as animal traps.""In a major development in the study of Harappan Civilisation, the researchers from Deccan College Pune and the Central Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have found that human remains unearthed at an ancient site of Rakhigarhi – a village in the Hisar district of Haryana – date back roughly 8,000 years. The finding was made during the third round of excavations conducted by the ASI in collaboration with several teams from across the country, including Deccan College Pune researchers, Hindustan Times reported.Dr. Amarendra Nath of the Indian Archaeology Department conducted the first phase of excavations at Rakhigarhi from 1997 to 2000, during which evidence of the North Harappan culture dating back to 2500 BC was discovered. Professor Vasant Shinde of Deccan College Pune led the second round of excavations at Rakhi Garhi from 2006 to 2013, collecting evidence and conducting DNA tests to establish that this culture was possibly over 4,000 years old. The ASI and Deccan College Pune have worked together over the past two years to complete the third phase of excavations at Rakhigarhi, led by ASI joint director Sanjay Kumar Manjul and Deccan College Pune assistant professor Prabhodh Shirwalkar.Shirwalkar told HT that the Harappan culture is divided into three parts: East Harappan, Middle Harappan, and North Harappan (Modern). The previous two excavations discovered evidence of the Middle and Modern Harappan cultures stretching back about 4,000 years. However, evidence discovered during the third round of excavations indicates that the culture dates back 7,000 to 8,000 years. “The final report of the work is being prepared by our team,” Shirwalkar said adding that the research will continue for many more months.Shirwalkar further elaborated, “Human ‘DNA’ has remained the same for 8,000 years which we have found during our research. When human traps were found here, they were thoroughly tested. Scientists have drawn conclusions based on this. A large burial ground was found here and it had human traps as well as animal traps.”Shirwalkar revealed that clay pots, old silver and copper ornaments were discovered alongside utensils made of various metals, including gold and silver as well and a dinner set was discovered during the excavation. During the excavations, a large settlement of the largest ancient houses ever was found underground. A courtyard along with a drainage system were also found in it. Moreover, there were two- to six-bedroom houses that were also available at that time. The clothing fashion of the people of that time is also known. The research team found a colourful worn piece of cloth, a shawl and a skirt.“This research has found strong evidence that the Harappan civilisation is 7,000 to 8,000 years old. Scientists from the Department of Archaeology of India and Deccan College have worked together on the project. It is agreed that there was human habitation or civilisation in our country 8,000 years ago,” Shirwalkar asserted adding that the people back then were as advanced as they are in present times.Back in 2019, it was reported citing a research study that the primary source of ancestry in modern South Indians is a prehistoric genetic gradient between people related to early hunter-gatherers of Iran and Southeast Asia. In a major blow to the Aryan Invasion Theory, the research found that the skeletal remains from the Rakhigarhi individual were from a population that is “the largest source of ancestry for South Asians”.The study which involved the inspection of DNA samples of the skeletons found in Rakhigarhi, an Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) site in Haryana, found no traces of the R1a1 gene or Central Asian ‘steppe’ genes, colloquially called the ‘Aryan gene’. In 2018 as well, OpIndia reported that researchers of the DNA study of Rakhigarhi skeletal remains have stated that they found no central Asian trace.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 December, 2023 ",‘Felt insulted’: Groom’s family in Hyderabad calls off wedding after bride’s family fails to serve mutton bone marrow to guests,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/telangana-hyderabad-grooms-family-calls-off-wedding-after-brides-family-failed-to-include-mutton-bone-marrow-in-menu/,"The groom's family claimed that the bride's family had purposefully concealed from them that bone marrow was not on the menu. In a bizarre incident, a groom’s family in Hyderabad, Telangana called off the wedding after seeing that the girl’s family had not served mutton with bone marrow to the wedding guests. According to reports, the argument over the petty issue snowballed into a full-blown fight with the local police having to enter the scene to pacify the groom’s family. Officials from the nearby police station attempted to persuade the groom’s family out of the altercation, but they remained unrelenting, furious over what they perceived as an ‘insult.’The groom’s family claimed that the bride’s family had purposefully concealed from them that bone marrow was not on the menu. Ultimately, the engagement party ended with the groom’s family calling off the wedding.According to reports, the bride’s family was from the Nizamabad district and the groom’s family was from the Jagtial district in Telangana. The families had decided on the wedding and the engagement took place at the bride’s residence recently.The bride’s family arranged for non-vegetarian meals for the bridegroom’s family members and relatives after both families decided on a traditional and lavish wedding.Just when everything was going according to plan, one of the guests pointed out that the non-vegetarian meal did not include any bone marrow of mutton. The hosts responded by saying that they hadn’t included bone marrow in the meals, which ultimately led to an altercation between both parties and the groom’s family calling off the wedding and the bride’s side agreed. Both families then left for their respective places without any reconciliation.Interestingly, a similar incident was reported from Hyderabad in February this year wherein a man named Mohammad Zakeer had called off his wedding, claiming that the bride’s family was giving him second-hand furniture as dowry.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"23 December, 2023 ","PornHub’s parent company admits it made profit by coercing women into performing sex acts on camera and posting it without their consent, fined 1.8...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parent-company-of-pornhub-admits-making-profit-from-sex-trafficking-fined-1-8-million-dollars/,"The accusations originate from the fact that the company hosted content and took money from a third party, Girls Do Porn (GDP).The Parent company of one of the biggest pornographic content websites in the world, PornHub, has acknowledged profiting from sex trafficking. It acknowledged having hosted adult videos in which women were forced to engage in sexual acts on camera; the business subsequently shared the videos online without the women’s consent.As part of a deferred prosecution agreement reached with federal prosecutors, Aylo, formerly known as MindGeek, would pay a fine of 1.8 million Dollars and compensate the victims of sex trafficking. Aylo, who entered a not-guilty plea to participate in illegal financial transactions involving proceeds from sex trafficking, will be under observation for three years, according to the agreement. The accusations against the corporation will be withdrawn if it abides by the conditions of the contract.The accusations originate from the fact that the company hosted content and took money from a third party, Girls Do Porn (GDP).According to court documents, Aylo continued to accept money from the GDP channel even after it was aware of sex trafficking allegations from some of the women appearing in the videos.Court records stated that Aylo failed to comply with all removal requests and independently checked consent, even after receiving requests from multiple women in 2016 and learning of federal action against the production business in 2017.The victims said that the GDP forced them to have sex on camera and misled them about how the footage would be disseminated. According to prosecutors, the company received more than $100,000 from GirlsDoPorn and roughly $764,000 in payments from advertisers attributable to the production company.In 2021, Aylo, then known as MindGeek, settled with 50 women out of court. “Aylo received money that Aylo knew or should have known was derived from the GDP Operators’ sex trafficking operations,” the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York alleged.In all, there were over 400 victims, and GDP producer Ruben Andre Garcia was given a 20-year federal jail sentence in 2021 for forcing women to appear in pornographic recordings.Later that year, the women gained the rights to the videos in which they had starred, and Garcia was forced to make amends by giving them $18 million.Notably, in the year 2020, the New York Times published an article levelling allegations that MindGeek’s sites were hosting material depicting rapes and sex involving minors.The NYT‘s 2020 article read, “Its site is infested with rape videos. It monetizes child rapes, revenge pornography, spy cam videos of women showering, racist and misogynist content, and footage of women being asphyxiated in plastic bags. A search for “girls under18” (no space) or “14yo” leads in each case to more than 100,000 videos. Most aren’t of children being assaulted, but too many are.”The article sparked intense scrutiny from regulators in several countries, and Visa and MasterCard suspended payment processing.It may be recalled that at the beginning of the year, Ethical Capital Partners (ECP), a Canadian private equity firm, bought MindGeek, the parent company of PornHub, bringing with it a stable of additional websites including YouPorn. The acquisition has also resulted in a slew of legal issues. In June this year, the new owner of PornHub said that the government should take pride in sexual expression instead of cracking down on porn websites. It further urged the governments to help make porn “normal and boring.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 December, 2023 ","18-year-old autistic teen given ‘life in hospital’ sentence after he hacked Nvdia, BT/EE, and then hacked GTA-VI without even a laptop in police custody",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/teenaged-hacker-sentenced-to-life-in-secure-hospital-by-uk-court-after-he-hacked-gta-vi/,"Kurtaj and the 17-year-old are the first Lapsus$ members to be convicted, although it is believed that others are still out on the loose. The gang's attacks in the years 2021 and 2022 stunned the cyber-security community. The group from the United Kingdom and Brazil was dubbed ""digital bandits"" in court.An 18-year-old hacker who was instrumental in leaking Grand Theft Auto VI footage has been sentenced to life in hospital imprisonment by a UK court. On Thursday (December 21), a British judge determined that Arion Kurtaj poses a high risk to the public because he continues to wish to commit cybercrime, BBC reported. The teenager hacked into Rockstar servers without using a computer and posted clips and source codes for the upcoming GTA-VI, while he was in police custody.Kurtaj, a key member of the international gang Lapsus$, was found guilty of cyberattacks on GTA VI developer Rockstar Games and other companies, including Uber and Nvidia, by a London jury in August. However, because Kurtaj suffers from autism and was declared unfit to stand trial, the jury was asked to decide whether he committed the crimes in question, rather than whether he did so with criminal intent.It was reported that accused Kurtaj leaked 90 videos of GTA-VI gameplay footage while on bail for hacking Nvidia and British telecom operator BT / EE last September. Despite staying in a hotel under police protection at this time and after police confiscated his laptop, Kurtaj was able to attack Rockstar Games without using a computer. He carried out the attack using the room’s Amazon Fire Stick and the TV, a newly purchased smartphone, a keyboard, and a mouse. Following the incident, Kurtaj was arrested.He stole 90 clips of the unreleased and hugely anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, and released them on social media, along with some source code. Before posting them, he threatened to release GTA source codes if Rockstar does not contact him. He broke into the company’s Slack messaging system to deliver the threat, saying, “if Rockstar does not contact me on Telegram within 24 hours I will start releasing the source code”.Kurtaj then posted the clips and source code on a GTA forum under the username TeaPotUberHacker. He posted 90 videos from a test build of Grand Theft Auto 6, running with “GTA 5 and 6 source code and assets”. The legitimacy of the videos was confirmed by Rockstar. After this, he was again arrested. After the hearing, the court sentenced him to spend his life in a hospital. The judge said Kurtaj’s skills and desire to commit cybercrime meant he remained a high risk to the public. Judge Patricia Lees said that the ‘only safe option’ was to detain him under section 37 of the Mental Health Act with a restriction order.Kurtaj will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger. He will be transferred to a secure psychiatric hospital in next month once a bed is available at Marlborough House medium-secure hospital in Milton Keynes. The court also noted that he had been violent during police custody, and there are dozens of incidents of injuries and property damages caused by him. A mental health assessment of the accused said that he continued to express the intent to return to cyber-crime as soon as possible, prompting the unique sentencing by the court. Meanwhile, another 17-year-old Lapsus$ member received an 18-month community punishment, known as a Youth Rehabilitation Order, along with a prohibition from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs). This youth, who can’t be named, suffers from ASD (autism spectrum disorder), and was sentenced to a youth rehabiliation order for 18 months earlier for hacking offences.Even after several videos leaked by Kurtaj and the trailer’s premature release on X (Twitter), the official trailer for GTA VI received hundreds of millions of views. Currently, the trailer has clocked around 155 million views on YouTube.While Kurtaj’s counsel asked the judge to consider the trailer’s success during the sentence, the BBC reports that the judge noted that Lapsus$ harmed real businesses and people. Rockstar Games told the court that it spent $5 million to recover from the hacking attack. Prosecutor Kevin Barry said that the attacks on Rockstar, Nvidia and Uber resulted in damages of £7.4m ($9.3m) for the companies.Kurtaj and the 17-year-old are the first Lapsus$ members to be convicted, although it is believed that others are still out on the loose. The gang’s attacks in the years 2021 and 2022 stunned the cyber-security community. The group from the United Kingdom and Brazil was dubbed “digital bandits” in court.The gang assumed to be primarily comprising teenagers, utilised con-man techniques as well as computer hacking to get access to multinational firms such as Microsoft, the technology behemoth, and digital banking firm Revolut. In their rampage, the hackers publicly boasted their crimes and ridiculed victims on the social network app Telegram in English and Portuguese.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"28 December, 2023 ","Delhi anti-Hindu riot: Prashant Bhushan hosted the earliest conspiracy meeting with Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Yogendra Yadav in attendance. Read details",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/delhi-anti-hindu-riot-prashant-bhushan-hosted-earliest-conspiracy-meeting-with-umar-khalid-sharjeel-imam-and-yogendra-yadav/,"Documents duly signed by Prashant Bhushan, prove that the exact address where the meeting was held on the 8th of December 2019, where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots was hatched according to the chargesheet, is indeed the office of Prashant Bhushan. The destruction and carnage unleashed during the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots 2020 left the nation in shock. On the 24th and 25th of February, Delhi was gripped with unbridled violence and riots that were unleashed after an elaborate conspiracy was hatched by certain Muslim groups and Left groups. Several conspirators have been charged and are lodged in jail, standing trial for their role in instigating and planning the violence. However, several individuals were either directly or tangentially involved in the conspiracy, who have not been named as accused in the investigation that followed the violence. The conspiracy chargesheet (59/2020) details how the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu riots took seed on the 5th of December. In the 2700-page chargesheet filed pertaining to FIR 59/2020, the Delhi Police dedicate almost 700 pages to the chronology of the conspiracy hatched. Confirming what OpIndia had already pointed out earlier, the February riots were inextricably linked to the December violence that was unleashed in various parts of the country such as Delhi, UP and other places.On the 5th of December, a WhatsApp group called Muslim Students of JNU was created by Sharjeel Imam. This was right after CAB (Citizenship Amendment Bill) was tabled in the Parliament. It was revealed in the chargesheet that Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi (a student of Jamia) were in constant touch and Sharjeel was also in touch with “radical communal group” Students of Jamia (SOJ). In 2023, Arshad Warsi was arrested by the Delhi Special Cell in connection with the Pune ISIS terror module. On the 6th of December, pamphlets which were written by Sharjeel Imam himself were distributed in the Jama Masjid area by the MSJ group. This fact was revealed by the chats recovered between Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi. The pamphlets were communal and essentially aimed to incite hate in the Muslim community by invoking the Supreme Court decision in the Ram Janmabhoomi case. Some of the pamphlets read “Law of Allah above all else” and “The command of Allah is above every law”.The pamphlets that were distributed in mosques on the 6th of December also had a call to join the protest called by ‘United Against Hate’ at Jantar Mantar in large numbers and to “mobilise mob”. On the 7th of December, Sharjeel Imam said that he would be joining the protests called by United Against Hate. This fact was revealed by his WhatsApp conversation with Arshad Warsi. While joining a protest is not wrong in itself, here is the clincher – on the 7th of December, Sharjeel Imam categorically said that he was planning something big in the next week and for that purpose, he would mobilise students from DU, AMU etc with the help of MSJ members.On the 7th of December, at the protest organised by United Against Hate, the chargesheet says that Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Nadeem Khan, Sharjeel Imam, Ifat and Sai Balaji were also present. They delivered speeches against the CAA at this protest. Umar Khalid, who was his “senior and mentor” from JNU introduced Sharjeel Imam to Yogendra Yadav at this agitation. Witnesses have told the police that earlier, Umar Khalid had already told Sharjeel Imam to make a group of “like-minded individuals” from JNU, Jamia, DU etc and had explained the concept of Chakka Jam to him. As an extension of that theme, at the meeting with Yogendra Yadav, he was told to “mobilise students of Jamia, DU and AMU”. According to the chargesheet, four important things were decided in this meeting: The entry of Yogendra Yadav in the conspiracy hatched, according to the chargesheet, dates back to the 7th of December 2019. This was only days before the Jamia violence erupted and several areas of Delhi saw violence. It was also days before Tahir Hussain admitted that he had started inciting people against CAA and pelted stones against the Hindus on the 17th.By the 7th of December, Umar Khalid and Yogendra Yadav had met Shajreel Imam. While the initial mobilisation had already started between the 5th and 7th of December, it is the events of the 8th of December that we will analyse in this report. On the 8th of December 2019, a meeting was held between Yogendra Yadav, Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid and others at a Jangpura basement. The image of this meeting has been included in the chargesheet by the Delhi Police. It was in this meeting, that according to the chargesheet, a plan was hatched on how to implement the Chakka Jam. It was decided that it would be Sharjeel Imam who would organise and lead students from various universities and colleges in and around Delhi. It was, interestingly, also decided that organisations like United Against Hate and Swarajya Abhiyaan would help each other in every way possible. This has, according to the Chargehsheet, been revealed by a witness. The fact that this meeting took place was also confirmed by the chats that were discovered between Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi. On the very same day of the meeting, a WhatsApp group was also formed (CAB TEAM) where Umar Khalid, Yogendra Yadav, Sharjeel Imam and other accused were present. According to the chargesheet, it is evident that this meeting in Jangpura was pivotal in the conspiracy that was hatched. It was in this meeting that the seeds of violence were sown and a collaborative effort between the organisations and people like Sharjeel Imam, and Umar Khalid was decided. According to the chargesheet, this pivotal meeting was held at a basement in Jangpura. The address of the meeting, as mentioned in the chargesheet, is 6/6, Jangpura Ext. When a cursory search is done, it turns out that the address, 6/6 Jangpura, is where the office of Prashant Bhushan is. Prashant Bhushan has multiple places from where he functions. His official chamber listed on the Supreme Court website (since he is an advocate on record) is New Lawyers Chamber, Supreme Court of India. 6/6 Jangpura, however, is his office which he has listed in several court documents. For example, in 2021, Prashant Bhushan was the lawyer representing a petition by Dr Jaboc Puliyel, demanding the release of vaccine data (trial and post vaccination data). Breaking: SC issues notice to the govt&vaccine companies on a petition by Dr Jacob Puliyel, former member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, seeking vaccine data (trial data & post Vaccination data)& against coercive vaccine mandateshttps://t.co/ulPCQqZPN1OpIndia found a communication by Prashant Bhushan to the Supreme Court, duly signed by him, where his office is listed at the basement of 6/6 Jangpura. This document to the Supreme Court, duly signed by Prashant Bhushan, proves that the exact address where the meeting was held on the 8th of December 2019, where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots was hatched according to the chargesheet, is indeed the office of Prashant Bhushan. The basement of 6/6 Jangpura – office of Prashant Bhushan, has birthed several anti-India campaigns apart from serving as the location where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu riots was hatched. Shanti Bhushan along with Prashant Bhushan had a few years ago set up the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Reform (CJAR) to supposedly demand accountability in the Indian judiciary. However, CJAR has been at the forefront of anti-India propaganda for long. In 2017, for example, the Supreme Court fined CJAR Rs 25,00,000 for its petition falsely accusing a judge of accepting bribes from a medical college to pass favourable orders. “No judge can be held responsible for what may or has happened in the corridors, or for ‘who purports to sell whom’. The alleged actions of a retired judge of a High Court, allegedly assuring and promising a ‘favourable’ decision… in a case which was then pending before this court, begs the question, and we wonder, as to what favourable orders have been passed,” the Bench had said in its order.CJAR was also at the forefront of running propaganda against CJI Dipak Mishra and furthering the narrative of the 4 judges who had held a press conference against the CJI at the time. Read: CJAR's press release on today's press conference by 4 seniormost judges of SC about the abuse of power of master of roster by CJI.We have also highlighted some of the politically sensitive cases where such power has been egregiously abused by the CJIhttps://t.co/TM6upzxoxeCJAR is, however, not the only organisation that functions out of 6/6 Jagpura. NAPM – National Alliance for People’s Movement is a far more vile organisation that also has its office at 6/6 Jangpura – essentially – functioning out of the office of Prashant Bhushan. NAPM was founded by Medha Patkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan fame in 1996. In 2022, Patkar was booked in a case of fraud. Medha Patkar and several others were accused of misusing funds in the name of educating tribal children. An FIR was lodged in Madhya Pradesh’s Barwani against Medha Patkar and 11 others in this regard. In the FIR, Pritam Raj, the complainant, accused Patkar of embezzling more than Rs 13 crore on the pretext of funding educational opportunities for tribal children. The complaint also alleged that Patkar had misappropriated funds since she did not have accounts for all of the donations collected for the education of the tribal poor between 2007 and 2022. According to the FIR, Medha Patkar raised more than Rs 13 crore through the ‘Narmada Navnirman Abhiyan’ foundation. She was accused of inciting anti-government sentiment by soliciting donations for education.Medha Patkar is best known for her ‘Narmada Bachao Andolan’ against the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river. The protest contributed to the years-long postponement of the Sardar Sarovar Dam project on the Narmada River. So-called social activists and environmentalists like Medha Patkar expressed concern as soon as the construction of the project started. When Medha Patkar visited the project site in 1985, she accused that the dam had fallen short of the social and environmental requirements set forth by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.For suspected money laundering during the “Narmada Bachao Andolan,” the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed an FIR against activist Medha Patkar on April 5 this year. In addition to the ED, investigations into Patkar’s shady dealings have also been initiated by the Department of Revenue Intelligence and the Income Tax Department.According to a Pioneer report, Patkar’s NGO received a donation of roughly Rs 1.2 crores within a year of its foundation in 2004 but managed to elude authorities for almost 17 years.The investigation raised several concerns regarding the payments. According to records obtained by Pioneer, the NGO received the funds on June 18, 2005, from 20 different sources in a single day. Surprisingly, the amount of all 20 donations was the same, which was Rs 5,96,294.  Pallavi Prabhaar Bhalekar, one of the donors, was a minor at the time the donations were transferred.Coming back to NAPM, it has participated in a number of propaganda campaigns whitewashing the crimes of Islamists and blaming Hindus. Its registered office is also at 6/6 Jangpura. It is pertinent to note that Medha Patkar had also participated in the anti-CAA protests which ultimately led to violence. NAPM had come out in support of GN Saibaba. GN Saibaba and several others were convicted and sentenced to life by the sessions court of Gadchiroli in March 2017 for association with the Revolutionary Democratic Front (RDF), an affiliate of CPI(Maoist). Saibaba and the others were found to be posing Naxal literature, and the court had said that they intended to circulate the literature among people in Gadchiroli to incite people to join the Naxals. Most of the material both in physical and electronic form was found with Saibaba, and he had introduced others accused in the case with the Maoist organisation.The continued incarceration of Prof. Saibaba, living with 90 % disability & chronic health issues is another disgraceful blot on the 'human rights record' of this Government! Unjustifiable that the @India_NHRC looks the other way despite being aware of the gravity of the issues. https://t.co/8VaGtEDm2MNAPM extended support to ‘The Kashmir Wala’ and others charged by NIA under UAPA. “The duo, under an active conspiracy and Pakistan’s support, resurrected a platform reviving the narrative in support of the terrorist and separatist ecosystem. They were spreading an anti-India narrative by exploiting digital platforms under a concealed and camouflaged set-up with the help of illicit funding received from hostile foreign agencies and proscribed terrorist organisations,” said an official privy to the case. Earlier in 2023, the court framed charges against Peerzada Fahad Shah. The persecution of democratic media by Modi regime is relentless! Not only has #TheKashmirWalla founder editor Fahad Shah been jailed unjustly since #18months, now the portal's digital presence has been shut off! This brutal crackdown on media in Kashmir must end. #FreeFahadShah https://t.co/7BGNRQm0aGThe organisation came out in support of NewsClick as well. NewsClick is in the dock for being funded by China and running their propaganda against the interest of India. NAPM condemns the vindictive targeting of @newsclickin in particular & independent news media in general by the current regime that does not want be accountable to the Constitution & We The People! Solidarity with progressive media, doing public service!✊🏽https://t.co/RzSVlacXKaThey blamed Hindus for the Nuh violence where Muslim mobs ran rampage attacking Hindu devotees. The hate-filled atmosphere in parts of #Haryana over the past week and violent persecution of muslims & working poor, must be seen in the light of the impunity that no less than @PMOIndia & @mlkhattar have afforded to the hindutva mobs. Shameful! #GuruGramViolence#NuhViolence https://t.co/u1UmDu62OAAs mentioned earlier, Medha Patkar, who founded NAPM, was also a part of the anti-CAA protests. Interstingly, NAPM’s registered office is the same as the registered office of Prashant Bhushan where the 8th December meeting between Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid, Yogendra Yadav and others were held, conspiring to unleash violence. Throughout the violence which started in December 2019 and lasted till the 26th of February 2020, NAPM was at the forefront of offering help and support to the accused. On the 15th of December 2019, NAPM extended support to the Jihadis of Jamia who committed unbridled violence during their anti-CAA protest. It is pertinent to note that the chargesheet also details how students of Jamia had attacked police with weapons, petrol bombs, rods and stick. These violent Jihadis had injured 10 policemen on duty. The police had found that this was a premeditated incident of violence. Movements from across the country stand with the students of Jamia Millia Islamia. We condemn the shameful and cowardly assault by the Delhi Police on the University and its students. Please join them in solidarity!#SOSJAMIANAPM too played to role of instigating mobilisation on the 15th of December 2019. Call to comrades to join all night protest against police brutality outside Delhi Police Headquarters at ITO in Delhi. pic.twitter.com/DBmrqfZ9u6They have rallied for the release of the Jihadis arrested pursuant to the chargesheet 59/2020 – those who were a part of the conspiracy. NAPM is deeply concerned about the scores of young people incarcerated by Delhi Police on questionable grounds since months! Many of them are muslims, students, women – all vulnerable in #COVID19 times! We condemn 150 days of unjust jailing & demand #ReleaseKhalidAndIshrat pic.twitter.com/H5HHme43sd19 Delhi-based scholars and activists who were a part of the nation-wide anti-CAA protests, have been wrongly booked under UAPA, Arms Act and others, and jailed since the start of 2020.

Drop the arbitrary charges #ScrapUAPA #ReleaseAllPoliticalPrisoners #FreeTheYoung pic.twitter.com/49cA2s0G8lIt is pertinent to note that NAPM is spreading propaganda, demanding for the release of Umar Khalid – the very Umar Khalid who was one of the masterminds of the Delhi anti-Hindu riots and was present for the 8th December meeting held at 6/6 Jangpura – the office of Prashant Bhushan and the registered office of NAPM. 2. In the 59/2020 chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police, the address of a meeting held between Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others on the 8th of December 2019 has been mentioned as 6/6 Jangpura basement. Was Prashant Bhushan present at the said meeting between Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid and others? 3. Was it in Bhushan’s knowledge that a plan for chakka jam and ensuing violence was being hatched at this meeting? 4. Whose proposal was it to hold the said meeting at Bhushan’s office space? 5. To what extend was Prashant Bhushan involved in the meeting? 6. Was he privy to the conversation being held during the meeting? 7. Ishrat Jahan and Khalid Saifi have named Prashant Bhushan in their disclosure statements during the Delhi Riots investigation. The statements mention that he had extensively participated in the anti-CAA protests which ultimately led to violence. Prashant Bhushan needs to be investigated for the extent of his involvement in these protests. 8. Was he a part of the DPSG Whatsapp group or any of the groups that were created to coordinate the protests and the ensuing violence? 9. Has the Delhi Police approached him to question him about the meeting held at his office basement, where the police say the conspiracy for the violence was hatched on the 8th of December 2019? The Delhi anti-Hindu riot was an elaborate conspiracy to teach Hindus a lesson. That this violence was specifically designed to target Hindus and the ruling government of India has been established by the Delhi Police in their chargesheets which painfully documents how the conspiracy to spark violence progressed daily ever since the 5th of December 2019. With one of the earliest meetings furthering the conspiracy being held at Prashant Bhushan’s office, it becomes imperative that Bhushan is questioned about his involvement in the violence and the conspiracy to spark violence.

"28 December, 2023 ",OpIndia Exclusive: Who introduced Robert Vadra to CC Thampi? ED’s chargesheet against Sanjay Bhandari mentions Sonia Gandhi link. Read here,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-introduced-robert-vadra-to-cc-thampi-eds-pmla-chargesheet-against-sanjay-bhandari-mentions-sonia-gandhi-link/,"In ED's supplementary chargesheet, it was established that Thampi was a close associate of Vadra. The connection was revealed through financial transactions, including the renovation of a London property and land deals in Faridabad.In its supplementary chargesheet at the PMLA court, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has finally established a direct connection between the Gandhi son-in-law Robert Vadra, CC Thampi and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. In a 84-page chargesheet, the ED has detailed how Robert Vadra was linked to Bhandari through a London property and how Vadra came in contact with CC Thampi, a crucial link in the case. The chargesheet reveals that it was Sonia Gandhi’s PA, Madhavan, who introduced Vadra to Thampi. Cheruvathur Chakkutty Thampi, a Delhi-based real estate dealer, is the accused no 7 in ED’s PMLA case against Sanjay Bhandari and his associates. The ED, on the chargesheet submitted on 22nd December to the Special Court, mentions that CC Thampi, who worked for the absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, is a close aide of Robert Vadra – the husband of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The ED established the link in the supplementary chargesheet filed against CC Thampi and Sumit Chadha (said to be a close relative of Sanjay Bhandari) in a money laundering case. This is the first time that ED has named Vadra in their chargesheet.Establishing the role of Sonia Gandhi’s PA in the matter, the charge sheet’s page 43 read, “During the course of investigation in the case, statements of Sh. CCT (CC Thambi) were recorded under Section 50 of PMLA on various dates. In his statement recorded on 19.06.2019, Sh. CCT stated that he knew Sh. Robert Vadra for more than ten years, and he (Sh. Robert Vadra) was initially introduced to him (Sh. CCT) by Mr. Madhavan, P.A. to Smt. Sonia Gandhi.”PP Madhavan has been Sonia Gandhi’s PA for a long time. In June 2022, he was accused of rape by a Dalit woman. However, Madhavan had stated that the charges against him were baseless. The Enforcement Directorate has named Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi and husband of Priyanka Gandhi, in a money laundering case linked to CC Thampi and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. In ED’s supplementary chargesheet, it was established that Thampi was a close associate of Vadra. The connection was revealed through financial transactions, including the renovation of a London property and land deals in Faridabad.Furthermore, links between Rahul Gandhi and CC Thampi were revealed, and it was suggested that HL Pahwa, reportedly funded by Thampi, was involved in the case. Priyanka Gandhi purchased land from Pahwa at a reduced price. The land was later sold back at an inflated price. The funds for these transactions were reportedly provided by Thampi. Our detailed report on the matter can be checked here. OpIndia had broken the HL Pahwa story and Priyanka Vadra connection back in 2019.

"25 December, 2023 ","Everything you need to know about The Telecom Bill 2023, and how it aims to modernise and secure the telecommunication sector in India",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-telecom-bill-2023/,"The telecom industry was managed in India by the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933. These two laws needed to be updated, and were not fully aligned with the current technological realities.On 21st December, the Telecom Bill 2023 was passed in Rajya Sabha, a day after it was passed in Lok Sabha. The bill introduced several critical changes aimed at benefitting the general public by modernising and securing the telecommunication sector in the country.The telecom industry was managed in India by the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933. These two laws needed to be updated, and were not fully aligned with the current technological realities. The Telecom Bill 2023 replaced both of them and introduced several clauses that will streamline the telecommunication industry as per the latest technological scenario in the country.One of the most prominent aspects of the bill is the streamlined authorisation and spectrum allocation. The bill mandates prior permission from the union government for telecommunication-related activities. The main aim is to streamline the process of managing telecommunication services. Spectrum allocation is primarily done via auction, except the allocation is done for specific purposes such as disaster management and national security.The approach will provide for a more flexible and scalable regulatory framework. It will help in forming a mechanism for quicker responses to technological advancements. The central government will be authorised to re-purpose or reassign any required frequency range. The government of India now holds the power to permit the sharing, trade, lease, and surrender spectrum.The bill emphasises on a strong verification process for telecom service provided. Now, it will be mandatory to get biometric-based identification for the subscribers before issuing SIM cards. The government has brought this change to enhance security and accountability within the telecom sector.Notably, the new bill has introduced strict penalties for fraudulent SIM procurement, mandatory consent for advertising messages, biometric-based subscriber verification, specific conditions for spectrum allocation, and stringent penalties for unauthorised telecom services or equipment. Furthermore, companies can procure telecom equipment only from trusted sources per the government’s guidelines.The government has now the power to intercept the messages and a class of messages between two or more persons if the government deems it necessary to do so for reasons including national security, prevention of incitement of offences or public order. On similar grounds, the government will have the right to suspend the telecom services. Furthermore, the government may take temporary possession of any telecom infrastructure or service for any public emergency. However, unlawful interception will attract penalties. In the earlier draft of the Telecom Bill, Over-The-Top services were categorised under telecommunication services. However, in the revised bill, the government opted for a more inclusive approach and encapsulated OTT within a broader definition of telecommunication. In short, if the government wishes to classify OTT services as “telecommunication services”, it can do it. The aim is to combat digital fraud and misuse of communication platforms.While services like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram are out of their purview, it has to be noted that OTT content is going to be monitored. The OTT entities will come under the purview of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, and the content distributed on these platforms will be overseen by the Information and Broadcasting Ministry. In the case of the satellite spectrum allocation, the bill specifically benefits the satellite broadband services sector. The bill has moved away from auction-based allocation to an administrative assignment model. It will allow the operators to bring enhancements efficiently in the sector.If the company surrenders the spectrum license, it could claim the fee paid at the time of the allocation. However, as per the new bill, there is no option to receive a refund of the fee if the entities surrender their license, registration, authorisation or assignment. It is aimed to bring financial discipline and commitment across the telecom sector and operators.The bill has removed the provisions of restructuring, the default of payment and insolvency. The aim is to bring a more market-driven approach to the sector where the telecom operators will be held responsible for their financial sustainability and risk management. It has been seen in the past that telecom operators leave the market all of a sudden due to financial mismanagement. By removing the provisions that may support such withdrawal of service from the market, the government aimed to bring more accountability on the operators’ part.The government renamed the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) “Digital Bharat Nidhi”. The bill introduced a broader operational scope to allow its use for new and existing telecommunication services and technologies. The idea is to move towards a more inclusive approach to telecommunication development in India.The bill has brought a clear distinction between broadcast services and telecommunications. Now, the broadcasting services have been referred to as per the Cable Television Networks Act for regulatory guidance. It will bring clearer regulatory boundaries and help streamline the frameworks across the sectors.Media houses are criticising the bill as it puts journalists under the scanner. According to mainstream media, as the new bill requires to furnish correct information, it could “impede whistle-blowers as well as journalists who operate under anonymity”. Interestingly, in recent times, several of the mainstream media stories turned out to be fake. Be it the Meta fiasco of The Wire or the Pegasus story that turned upside down when investigated. Who can forget how The Wire forged a complete investigation to blame the BJP for running an underground app, “Tek Fog“?Furthermore, PRS Legislative Research claimed that the provision of surveillance would lower the degree of privacy of communications for all users. However, such arguments fail to comprehend the depth of telecommunication usage by the anti-India elements and terrorist organisations. Any such activity can be put to rest at the foundation stage if the interception of such messages is done properly as per the guidelines.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 December, 2023 ","No missile tests, no fishing, ‘Arribada’ is happening: Read how Odisha prepares to welcome lakhs of Olive Ridley turtles coming from faraway oceans",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/no-missile-tests-no-fishing-arribada-odisha-prepares-to-welcome-lakhs-of-olive-ridley-turtles/,"The migration of sea turtles is a biological phenomenon that has intrigued scientists for decades. We are yet to fully understand how sea turtles manage to find their way through thousands of miles across oceans of the world and come to the same beach generation after generation. Turtles contribute significantly to ocean ecosystems by maintaining healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs, which provide critical habitats for other marine life. They also play a significant role in the balance of marine food webs and the transfer of nutrients from water to land. Unfortunately, many of the turtle species have become critically endangered and are losing lives as a result of human activities. For instance, around 800 Olive Ridley sea turtles died on a beach in Odisha after getting stuck in fishing nets in 2021. Many dead turtles bore injuries, which pointed to the possibility of them being trapped in a trawl or gill net. In Kasaragod, Kerala on 5th June this year, 56 turtles were found burnt to death following a fire at a wetland in Madavayal near Pilicode. In Mumbai, in January this year, dozens of turtles died due to deliberate poisoning last year. As per the locals, the turtles were illegally staying in the lake and were eating the fish so they were poisoned. Humans at times, fail to realize that the extinction of turtles is causing harm to the marine biodiversity and that conservation of turtles is crucial to help conserve biodiversity and to maintain natural balance.The migration of sea turtles is a biological phenomenon that has intrigued scientists for decades. We are yet to fully understand how sea turtles manage to find their way through thousands of miles across oceans of the world and come to the same beach generation after generation. Odisha’s coastal areas, especially the mouth of some rivers in the state are crucial nesting grounds for Olive Ridley turtles. Every year, lakhs of Olive Ridley turtles come to lay their eggs on the beaches. The turtle mothers go back. When the eggs hatch, the hatchlings start another epic voyage across the sea to their habitats across the oceans, only to come back as adults to the very same beach where they had hatched. To welcome, and provide a safe nesting to these ocean guests, the Odisha govt and the center go to extraordinary lengths. The Odisha government and the Central Government have together imposed a prohibitory ban on sea fishing activity within 20 km of the coast in Kendrapara, Odisha where the Olive Ridley turtles come ashore to nest and lay eggs.According to the reports, the ban has been imposed from the 1st of November and will remain in force until 31st May 2024. As per the forest department official, the areas notified include the sea around the mouths of the rivers Dhamara, Devi, and Rusikulya to guarantee the safety of marine animals such as Olive Ridley turtles during the nesting and breeding season.Every year, the prohibition is tightened as more turtles are killed by becoming entangled in fishing nets or being hit by the propellers of fishing trawlers. The annual measure will remain in effect in the Olive Ridley turtle habitation corridors by the provisions of the Orissa Marine Fishing Regulation Act (OMFRA), 1982, and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, government officials have informed.The female Olive Ridley turtles essentially invade the nesting beaches typically at the dead of the night for laying eggs – a phenomenon which is called ‘Arribada’, which means ‘arrival by the sea’ in Spanish. . Turtles leave the nesting area after laying their eggs to return to the deep sea. After 45-60 days, hatchlings emerge from the eggs. It is a rare natural occurrence in which baby turtles grow without their mothers before being released into the sea.As of now, the Olive Ridley turtles have started arriving on the coastal waters. Officials have spotted them mating in the coastal waters. The ‘Arribada’ will start in a few weeks. Our guests have arrived. Mass mating of Olive Ridley have started off the coast of Odisha at Rushikulya & Gahiramatha rookery. Arribada, meaning “arrival by sea”, for mass nesting is few weeks away only. pic.twitter.com/Eqmf1SqASTOlive Ridley turtles turn up in lakhs for mass nesting along the Odisha coast every year. They lay eggs in en-mass at the Gahirmatha beach in Kendrapara strict, the Rushikulya river mouth in Ganjam, and the Devi river mouth in Puri.In addition to Coast Guard personnel, a multi-layered state-sponsored patrolling exercise involving forest, fisheries, and marine police would also be implemented during the prohibition period. In Bhadrak, Rajnagar, Puri, and Berhampur, the state’s four wildlife divisions, 61 on-shore camps, and five offshore camps have been established to guarantee efficient patrolling. The patrolling teams for the forests and fisheries will be flanked by the armed police constabulary.Thirteen trawlers, support boats, and five high-speed boats have further been called into action to stop illicit marine fishing in restricted areas.Notably, the fishing prohibition will have an impact on over 10,600 fishing families. So, the state government has decided to give each of the impacted fishermen’s families a one-time livelihood assistance of Rs 15,500 to make up for the loss of their income. The Gahirmatha coast, which is hailed as the largest habitation corridor of Olive Ridley turtles, has a complete year-round ban on sea fishing. Given the population of turtles, it has been granted the designation of marine sanctuary.Sea turtles have traveled great distances throughout the world’s oceans for over 100 million years, playing a crucial role in maintaining the equilibrium of marine habitats. From the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific to the vibrant reefs of the Coral Triangle and the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, seven distinct species of sea (or marine) turtles inhabit our ocean waters. Although sea turtles are highly migratory animals, they spend the majority of their lives in the ocean. At times, they come ashore to nest or bask.The seven species, most of which stand endangered today are Leatherback, Loggerhead, Green turtle, Flatback, Hawksbill, Kemp’s Ridley, and Olive Ridley. Among these Leatherback, Loggerhead, and Olive Ridley have become vulnerable whereas Green Turtle, Hawksbill, and Kemp’s Ridley have become critically endangered. As per the research report by World Wild Life, hundreds and thousands of members of these species are lost each year to incidental capture during fishing, overharvesting, and illegal trade. Human activity has shifted the odds against the survival of these ancient mariners during the past 200 years. Sea turtles are killed for their meat, eggs, skin, and shells. they are also overfished and subject to poaching. In addition, they have to deal with habitat degradation and unintentional bycatch in fishing gear. Turtle nesting sites are impacted by climate change since it changes the temperature of the sand, which in turn affects the sex of the hatchlings. Three of the seven species of sea turtles that are currently recognized are critically endangered which is a fact to worry about. Considering the given status, the Central government has also stepped up to conserve the species and not disturb them during their nesting period. Earlier this month, India’s top military research and development organization, the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), decided to suspend missile testing at Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha from January to March 2024 to give the endangered Olive Ridley sea turtle species a strong chance of surviving. The said decision was made by a committee headed by Odisha chief secretary P K Jena. The Integrated Test Range at the Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Chandipur in Odisha is where many of India’s missiles and weapons systems are tested. All testings have now been suspended for 3 months so that Olive Ridley turtles are not disturbed. As per a Times of India report, the Coast Guard and Army will also patrol the coast to prevent fishing boats and trawlers from approaching the small stretches of sand that are near bays and estuaries, where turtles lay their eggs. The chief secretary stated that the committee emphasized the necessity of sending out advisories to businesses, establishments, and industrial buildings along the coast to adhere to outdoor lighting laws. The director of the Integrated Testing Range (ITR) at Chandipur in Balasore has further been urged by the wildlife division to make space available for the establishment of temporary forest camps outside Abdul Kalam Island’s perimeter.“The DRDO will also nominate a nodal officer for better coordination with the forest department for the safety of the Olive Ridleys,” an official was quoted as saying. Marine turtles are an essential component of marine ecosystems. Seagrass beds and coral reefs that support commercially valuable species like prawns, lobster and tuna are kept healthy with their assistance. Sea turtles are the living embodiment of a class of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years. Turtles are highly valued both as tourist attractions and cultural icons. Five of the seven species can be found worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical waters. The ranges of the remaining two species, however, are quite small: the Flatback turtle is primarily found in northern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea, while the Kemp’s Ridley is primarily found in the Gulf of Mexico.With this broad global turtle picture, it is important for India to conserve the vulnerable turtle species that are also on the verge of becoming extinct now. Olive Ridley’s vulnerable status comes from the fact that they nest in a very small number of places, and therefore any disturbance to even one nest beach could have huge repercussions on the entire population. It’s just a question of a few months until they settle completely. The fishermen and the locals who unknowingly or deliberately cause harm to the species must understand the core and work towards peaceful co-existence. It is then that India will have a robust ocean ecosystem maintained by healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs, which ultimately will provide critical habitats for other marine life.A sight that casts magical spell year after year👍 Nearly 2 crore plus olive Ridley hatchlings have emerged & made their way to sea from half of about 4 lakh nesting at Nasi-2 islands, Gahirmatha rookery Odisha.The spectacle continues. Early morning video. pic.twitter.com/C0IKTWNCkoWith sustainable and inclusive efforts from the state and central government, and with the help of local people, the coasts of Odisha are eagerly waiting for the annual guests to arrive in large numbers and have a safe nesting season. The government officials and volunteers will then put all their efforts into ensuring safe hatching for the millions of eggs on the beaches. When the little hatchlings leave the beach to swim thousands of miles back to their home waters, the same beaches will wish them a safe voyage, and safe growing years, and hope they come back as adults again.

"28 December, 2023 ",Maharashtra: ‘What will they do with the seats?’ asks Congress as it rejects Uddhav Sena’s demand for 23 seats for Lok Sabha elections,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/maharashtra-congress-rejects-uddhav-senas-demand-for-23-seats-for-lok-sabha-elections/,"Former Chief Minister and senior Maharashtra Congress leader Ashok Chavan stated that the parties needed to adjust. ""While every party desires a larger share of seats, the demand for 23 seats by the Shiv Sena was excessive given the current circumstances,"" he said.The Congress Party has rejected the Shiv Sena’s (UBT) demand for 23 seats in Maharashtra in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The development came after Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi partners Shiv Sena (UBT), Congress, and NCP met to talk about seat sharing for the Lok Sabha elections.Despite the majority of its members supporting CM Eknath Shinde’s faction, the UBT Sena reportedly demanded 23 of the 48 seats in Maharashtra. According to Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam, Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena faction faces an enormous obstacle because it lacks sufficient candidates due to the party’s division.Following the splits in the Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar’s NCP, Congress representatives at the meeting stated unequivocally that the grand old party seems to be the only one with an established vote share in the state.Former Chief Minister and senior Maharashtra Congress leader Ashok Chavan stated that the parties needed to adjust. “While every party desires a larger share of seats, the demand for 23 seats by the Shiv Sena was excessive given the current circumstances,” he said.According to Sanjay Nirupam, leaders ought to prevent conflicts over winning seats. “The Shiv Sena may demand 23 seats, but what will they do with them? The Shiv Sena’s leaders have left, resulting in a crisis. Shiv Sena faces a candidate shortage,” he said. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut stated last week that he and party leaders Uddhav Thackeray and Aaditya Thackeray met with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, senior leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, as well as AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, before the recent Opposition bloc I.N.D.I Alliance meeting.Raut did not specify how many seats the Congress and NCP would contest. The Shiv Sena was part of the BJP-led NDA alliance in 2019. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party is now a member of the MVA, along with the Congress and the NCP.Eknath Shinde and 40 other Shiv Sena MLAs ‘revolted’ against the Shiv Sena leadership in June 2022, resulting in a party split and the collapse of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Shinde then joined forces with the BJP to form the state government.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Robert Vadra also purchased agricultural land measuring 40 kanal (05 acres) in village Amipur, District Faridabad, Haryana from Sh. H.L. Pahwa in April, 2006…,” ED chargsheet reads.Back in 2019, OpIndia had unearthed papers that linked Rahul Gandhi himself to Sanjay Bhandari through a string of dubious land deals involving HL Pahwa and CC Thampi – who the ED has now acknowledged is a close aide of Robert Vadra.These papers are related to the ED search conducted on one HL Pahwa on 3rd May 2017 and 4th May 2017. The land dealings are between Rahul Gandhi and H L Pahwa who was funded by CC Thampi – CC Thampi was known to be a close aide of Robert Vadra. As per the ED chargesheet filed in the PMLA court on 22nd December, CC Thampi has stated to ED that he was introduced to Robert Vadra by Sonia Gandhi’s PA Madhavan. OpIndia revealed in 2019 that not only Rahul Gandhi but also Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had purchased land from HL Pahwa. According to a sale deed dated 3 March 2008, Gurgaon resident HL Pahwa sold nine acres of land in Hasanpur village in Haryana’s Palwal district to Robert Vadra for Rs 36.9 lakh. In addition, a sale record from Rajasthan’s Bikaner district shows that Sarita Devi Bothra, 42, sold 4.63 acres of land in Basti village in Ganganagar tehsil for Rs 8.5 lakh to Real Earth Estate Private Limited, a New Delhi-based company, in April 2009. Notably, Robert Vadra is the company’s director.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also bought land from HL Pahwa. OpIndia earlier reported that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra purchased land and then sold it for an inflated price to the same person four years later. The person in question was also HL Pahwa. On April 28, 2006, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra purchased land from HL Pahwa for Rs. 15,00,000 in two cheques, and subsequently sold it back to HL Pahwa for Rs. 84,15,006 via multiple cheques on February 17, 2010.As reported earlier, here the link between HL Pahwa and CC Thampi emerges. When Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sold the land back to HL Pahwa at an exorbitant price, Pahwa repaid Gandhi in five instalments between May 22nd and September 11th, 2009. The stated reason for the instalment payment was ‘non-availability of funds’.CC Thampi was arrested in 2020 and is currently out on bail. In February 2019, Robert Vadra was grilled for over 5 hours for his alleged links to CC Thampi. The Enforcement Directorate suspects kickbacks for a petroleum deal in 2009 were routed through the Sharjah-based company, allegedly controlled by a UAE-based NRI businessman, CC Thampi. Vadra was also questioned about owning Benami property in London along with CC Thampi and Sanjay Bhandari. Thampi has a company in UAE called Sky Light and in India, Skylight Hospitality Private Limited is allegedly linked to Vadra and is under the ED scanner for suspect land deals in Bikaner, Rajasthan. ED had served him a show-cause notice last year for violation of laws in the acquisition of agricultural and other lands in and around Delhi-NCR in deals amounting to over Rs 288 crore.The ED chargesheet mentions that between 2005 and 2008 Thampi purchased around 486 acres of land from Pahwa in the same Amipur village in Faridabad. The chargesheet mentions that Pahwa was receiving cash ‘out of the books’ when Priyanka sold the land to him. Also, Robert Vadra reportedly did not pay the entire sale consideration to Pahwa. CC Thampi is accused number 7 in the ED’s PMLA case against Sanjay Bhandari and associates. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"28 December, 2023 ","‘Make Mayawati PM candidate if you want BSP in I.N.D.I. Alliance’, says BSP MP Malook Nagar",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bsp-will-join-i-n-d-i-alliance-if-mayawati-is-made-pm-candidate-mp-malook-nagar/,"BSP MP Malook Nagar said, ""To effectively challenge the BJP, the I.N.D.I. alliance must nominate Mayawati as their candidate for Prime Minister. If that does not happen, no coalition stands a chance against Modi.""On Wednesday (27th December), BSP MP from Bijnor Malook Nagar said that the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will consider joining the I.N.D.I. alliance if it makes BSP-supremo Mayawati the Prime Ministerial candidate in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections of 2024. This statement by Mayawati’s close aide Malook Nagar has come after UP Congress president Ajay Rai suggested the BSP should seriously consider joining the I.N.D.I. alliance.BSP MP Malook Nagar added that the Congress must apologise for weaning away BSP MLAs in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan after the 2018 assembly elections. He claimed that Mayawati is the tallest Dalit leader in the country and support for her cuts across states. He said, “By projecting Mayawati as the PM candidate, the INDIA alliance will be able to stop the BJP from winning a third consecutive term in the upcoming Lok Sabha election. To effectively challenge the BJP, the I.N.D.I. alliance must nominate Mayawati as their candidate for Prime Minister. If that does not happen, no coalition stands a chance against Modi.”Malook Nagar further said, “The victory formula for the alliance is clear. In the 2022 (Uttar Pradesh) assembly election, the BJP polled 41.3% votes. The parties constituting the INDIA bloc polled around 40% votes and the BSP secured around 13% votes. If the BSP joins the alliance, the vote percentage will go above 50% which is enough to snatch power from the BJP.”The BSP leader added, ” The projection of Mayawati as the PM candidate will also bring back the Dalit voters who have been lured by the saffron brigade. The I.N.D.I. alliance should decide to project the BSP chief as the PM candidate. Mayawati will (then) not only forgive the Congress for its misdeed to poach the BSP MLAs in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh but will also have a positive approach towards the I.N.D.I. alliance offer.”Malook Nagar said, “No matter how much anyone discusses Ram temple, it will benefit the BJP. Ram belongs to all of us, not just the BJP, but the politics and questions raised about the temple will benefit the BJP in the coming days.”Notably, Congress is willing to take BSP along in the I.N.D.I. alliance. However, other parties in the alliance are not welcoming BSP. Especially, the Samajwadi Party of Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Dal of Jayant Choudhari are not willing to join hands with the BSP.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"27 December, 2023 ","As goons attack shops over ‘smaller Kannada fonts’ on signboards in Bengaluru, here is how Karnataka Congress leaders have been fanning the language divide...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/here-is-how-congress-leaders-has-been-fanning-the-language-row-that-led-to-pro-kannada-violence/,"In May this year, just before the Assemby elections, Congress and other opposition leaders spread mass hysteria that ‘outside’ companies (non-Karnataka-based) will trample the local businesses, which could lead to ‘cultural, political, lingual, and economic subjugation’. Tensions have been escalating in Karnataka particularly Bengaluru after several outfits carried out violent protests over the language row. Members of pro-Kannada activist group Karnataka Rakshana Vedike stormed the streets in Bengaluru on 27th December (Wednesday). As per reports, the protestors pelted stones and vandalised and defaced the properties of several business establishments after accusing them of not using or boldly highlighting the mandated percentage of Kannada language in their signboards.  Conspicuously, the goons displaying violent linguistic chauvinism gained strength from the fact that the administration and ruling party leaders had made statements fanning the language divide. Two days ago, the BBMP order made it mandatory to display signage covering 60% of space with content in the Kannada language while the rest 40% could be in English. And Karnataka Rakshana Vedike is demanding immediate implementation of this rule. They even attacked establishments having separate English and Kannada signboards, demanding that all signboards must have Kannada occupying at least 60% space.The today’s vandalism comes after repeated comments of ruling Congress leaders, both before and after the elections, calling for wider use of Kannada in the state.Earlier on 17th October, Karnataka CM and Congress stalwart Siddaramaiah asserted that everyone living in Karnataka should learn to speak Kannada. He said, “We are all Kannadigas, people speaking different languages have settled in Kannada land since the unification of Karnataka. Everyone living in Karnataka should learn to speak Kannada.”He argued that in some parts, other language speakers didn’t learn or speak anything in Kannada for which he blamed the negligence and generosity of Kannadigas that allowed it.    He demanded that Kannadigas should ask non-Kannada speakers to learn their language instead of themselves learning other languages. He added, “Instead of Kannadigas teaching our language to others, we are learning their language first. In some parts of the state, the diaspora does not speak Kannada at all. This is happening because of the generosity of the Kannadigas.”The Chief Minister noted that although Kannada had been the official language for many years, negligence might have been the main reason behind the non-implementation of Kannada in the administration. He stressed that while one should respect other languages, one should not forget their own language. In May this year, just before the Assemby elections, Congress and other opposition leaders spread mass hysteria that ‘outside’ companies (non-Karnataka-based) will trample the local businesses, which could lead to ‘cultural, political, lingual, and economic subjugation’. The Congress party and its ecosystem which was also assisted by JDS back then, used the Amul-Nandini controversy to whip up regionalism and linguistic chauvinism by framing non-Kanadigas as outsiders, potential usurpers and cultural imperalists. Former Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah even appealed to the Kannadigas to boycott the Amul brand as it was not based in the state.While speaking about the matter, he had said, “In addition to language treason by the imposition of Hindi and land treason by trespassing within the state borders, now the BJP government is going to betray the farmers by shutting down Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), which is the livelihood of millions of dairy farming families in the country.”Congress leader DK Shivakumar suggested a larger conspiracy in the entry of Amul into the Karnataka market. The controversy fueled sub-regionalism and stroked langague and culture war. An escalated langauge war also erupted after the prominent opposition leaders from Congress went after labels on FMCG products particularly Dahi.  Additionally, on the counting day for assembly elections, Congress CM candidate Siddaramaiah had reprimanded journalists for using Hindi. Responding to media queries, he dragged the language divide, refused to answer questions in Hindi, and asked reporters to either use English or Kannada.In April 2022, in a controversial response to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s opinion that Hindi could be looked at as an alternative to English, the Congress leader had asserted that Hindi is not India’s national language and he will never let it happen. He alleged that it was an agenda of unleashing “cultural terrorism” against non-Hindi-speaking states.He had demanded, “It is time for the BJP to understand that more linguistic and cultural autonomy should be given to states.” The language war stroked in the guise of so-called Hindi imposition and protection of interests of Karnataka had led to mainstreaminging rabid lingiustic chauvinist groups like Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) which has been working in tandem with Congress party on host of issues for years. Reportedly, it is the KRV that led today’s violent protests across the city coercing shopkeepers and vendors to make an immediate transition and using Kannada on their signboards.During the Amul-Nandini fiasco, joining and supporting the then opposition party Congress’ narrative and call, Members of the ‘Kannada Rakshana Vedike’ had also hit the streets and staged protests against Amul while furthering its agenda of linguistic chauvinism and Hindi-imposition rhetoric.  During the Cauvery water dispute this year, organisations like KRV meet Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah to extend their support. They also called a bandh over the issue.Incidentally, just like the anti-farm law protest in New Delhi after the Centre passed three agriculture laws, the Karnataka Congress worked in tandem with outfits like KRV and staged violent protest against two amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms (KLR) Act and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act passed by the BS Yediyurappa government in 2020. Meanwhile, for several years, T-shirts with slogans like, “Hindi Gotthilla Hogo. Naavu Kannadigaru, Naavu Dravidaru” (We don’t know Hindi, go away. We are Kannadigas, we are Dravidians), have been allowed to go mainstream on social media platforms regularly. Similar campaigns have also been running in Tamil Nadu. A similar hashtag #ServeInMyLanguage had demanded that government services should be made available in Kannada for Kannada-speaking people. These hashtags started by the Kannada Grahakara Koota fan language divide and have been followed by groups like Karnataka Rakshana Vedike that hit the streets on to protest to fight against the so-called imposition of Hindi. Incidentally, these outfits have been on the same page with the Congress party in the state and vice-versa, emboldening them. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 December, 2023 ",Is Raghuram Rajan the ‘disease’ or a symptom of a wider disease: Defining the Woke problem and what the solution can be,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/raghuram-rajan-symptom-disease-woke-problem-solution/,"The Jewish lobby has already found their most potent cure – just cut off the funds. It is producing results. A lot of the leftist academics have started crawling, walking back on naked antisemitism, and issuing holy statements drafted by costly PR agencies. Some, like Gay, are holding out, backed as they are by powerful forces including likes of Obama.Is Rajan just a disease or a symptom of a much wider disease?First, let me apologise for using this rather strong term to describe a man, for all his defects, is intelligent, erudite, and accomplished. With my limited English, I could not find anything better. There is no personal insult meant. I am merely questioning his politics which I am entitled to as a citizen.Let us take each of the two options one by one and see where they fall. I leave it to you to be the judge!First, let us consider if he is just a “disease” and not something worse.His recent statements (and ones not so recent as well) have bordered on the bizarre and ludicrous. I would not bore you with the details since there are excellent articles that deal with that topic – such as the recent one by Karuna Gopal and Abhishek Banerji. I have also written about his assault on PLI and manufacturing which were dangerous. Other renowned academics have confirmed I was on the right track by saying India needs manufacturing jobs. His open endorsement of Rahul Gandhi and not-so-successful attempts to quote the Shehzade with multiple coats of intellectual paint that seems to wash off quickly are bad enough. And then he supports the likes of P. Chidambaram and his son who face serious allegations of corruption. As if all that were not enough, he did one better than Jairam Ramesh by trying to provide an anti-Modi spin on the huge cash haul at the premises of a Congress MP. I am trying hard to differentiate between him and Mani Shankar Aiyar but so far have been unsuccessful. At least Mani Shankar is no hypocrite and no one outside of the Palazzo servant quarters takes him seriously. And he seems to be not stopping there. Pragya Mishra is his next target to overtake! What next? Beat Supriya Shrinate?Only Rajan himself can explain the reasons and motives, I can only speculate. My guess is, that he is desperate to become India’s next PM if not FM – and all his recent politically loaded “economic” statements seem to show his frustration that the goal is slipping out of reach at least until 2029. One charitable excuse is that he has been granting “interviews” to so many known dynastic doormats that finding new anti-Modi things to say is so hard. He ends up saying patently nonsensical things. While anyone can have ambitions and go for it, to see an academic at these levels is a sad sight indeed. He has reduced himself to a meme, caricature, and joke. That is why I used the term “disease”.Let us turn to my other option – he is just a symptom of a much wider disease. Here the evidence is very strong too. Wokeism, as we all know well, is a disease. The West at least the English-speaking parts, seems to suffer from it without a cure in sight. And Rajan is just one of the many symptoms of this disease. We have seen the nasty plagiarism allegations against Harvard President Claudine Gay that don’t seem to die down. Even WaPo and NYT were forced to call for her to quit!  That’s like Pyongyang Times saying maybe Kim should go. Academia in the US has been completely overrun by leftist fringe and wokes and they are imposing their fascist tyranny of the minority, to quote Vivek Ramaswamy) in unprecedented ways. Universities are now full-fledged grooming centres for fringe left, no longer centres of excellence. Companies are even thinking of cutting back on hiring from such swamps. Real academics and faculty are too scared even to speak – for fear of losing their jobs, careers and worse.What has Rajan got to do with it? Well, the point is, given the substantial control fascist left woke Gestapo and the deep state exercise over academia, their ability to make or mar careers, cancel anyone that crosses them or reward the loyal with lucrative gigs and positions, many Indian academics (along with American or others) crawl when asked to bow. Why not board the gravy train instead of being run over by it or left on the platform? That too given your talents and skills, you are not likely to discover a cure for cancer or the next Lithium battery. When the best you can manage is another article on gender intersection or some such nonsense in pseudo-science?That was a hint! Two things you must know about this gang of academics that have been more woke than Pelosi or AOC. One is almost without exception they are from the pseudo-science faculties – not real science. Yes, we are talking sociology, politics “science”, economics etc.  You can’t be a Marxist physicist or Communist Endocrinologist, but you can very well be a radical leftist political “science” professor. Most are.The second and more relevant to India is, that practically all of them are from the upper classes of Indian society. You can do an informal caste census as Rahul Gandhi demands (even in meetings with journalists!). Next time you come across some West-based Desi academic spouting anti-Modi or anti-Hindu hate, wear their agnosticism or rationalism on their sleeves or brown-nosing themselves at dacoit dynastic rears, just check the caste. You will agree.Just as Claudine Gay types exploited the DEI and other such affirmative action moves to land lucrative jobs when their track record would not have justified it by any logical means, these Indian academics have cornered their gigs and positions by exploiting the “let’s get more POC and not be so WASPy” trend among US/UK colleges and universities that started sometime in the 80s. Before that, you had to be exceptionally brilliant even to step in and break the glass barrier. With the opening of the floodgates, a lot of mediocre talent has swept in. They would not have stood the slightest chance in the 60s or even 70s. Having secured them, now they need to hold their positions, climb the ladder and keep the gravy train going. The best and easiest way, of course, is to sing the woke tunes and not miss a beat. If Maoist comrade Kavita Krishnan can declare her pronouns, why can’t some US-based desi academic spout woke nonsense? All that is fine, but what’s the link to India? The connection to Indian and Indian politics is that woke left obedience to Islamist jihadist ideologies and priorities is absolute and non-negotiable. That makes Modi and BJP public enemy No.1. Given substantial funding of these varsities by Qatar etc, this makes eminent financial sense too. India’s Stalinist left has convinced their woke pals in the USA (and West) that bringing the dynasty back to power with remote control firmly in their hands is important. Therefore, the global woke left ecosystem has now become key facilitators and force multipliers in the Stalinist anti-Hindu pogrom of the Indian left. I mentioned the topic of caste. That brings us to an additional point that will explain the virulent woke hysteria, sickening dynastic sycophancy, anti-Hinduism cleverly dressed up as anti-Hindutva (that trick almost worked with Jews/Zionism but see below) by the likes of Shruti Kapila, Ananya Vajpayee, Salil Tripathi, Rajan, Basu, Priyamvada Gopal and the likes. There are dozens if not hundreds more. As I mentioned earlier, many are likely beneficiaries of West’s attempts to be more inclusive. But the genuine Indian subaltern groups have now woken up to a very simple fact – most of the lucrative gigs that followed from such “let us be nice to black, brown, yellow and other POC” have been cornered by the upper caste Indian elites. They are now demanding a share of the pie. And the pie is shrinking. If Trump returns, it will get worse.Again, what is the best way to keep riding the gravy train? Be “woker than the wokes”, attack India, BJP, and Hindus non-stop, follow the deep state party line on Ukraine, Putin, Gaza or whatever, and sing the praise of Rahul Gandhi because that is what the Indian left demands. If not, they will start talking about “privileged birth” and cast evil eyes on your nice cushy gig. They are essentially taking out an insurance policy – one where there is not only no premiums to be paid, but it is more dollars in your bank account. Add Soros, Ford and Omidyar types to the mix, you see the point even more clearly.Do you follow why I say symptom of a much wider disease? Rajans may come or go one day but the disease remains.Now, what is the cure? The Jewish lobby has already found their most potent cure – just cut off the funds. It is producing results. A lot of the leftist academics have started crawling, walking back on naked antisemitism, and issuing holy statements drafted by costly PR agencies. Some, like Gay, are holding out, backed as they are by powerful forces including likes of Obama.Unfortunately, this cure is not available to Hindus simply because we don’t have anywhere near that financial clout.

"25 December, 2023 ","According to The Hindu, democracy has died yet again after the passage of the Telecom Bill. Why? Because it won’t allow journalists to lie...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/telecommunication-bill-the-hindu-leftist-criticism-journalists/,"The English media has yet again failed to provide an accurate assessment of an important legislation. As is their wont, they have fallen back on archaic arguments expecting the people to lap them up. The people have done well to ignore them.Bharat’s Parliament approved the Telecommunications Bill, 2023 in the recently concluded winter session. This act will now replace three archaic laws from the years 1885, 1933, and 1950. You read the years right. They are not a typo. Up until now, we were still governed by laws passed in 1885 too!  According to the English media, democracy is either in danger in India or has already died in India. Any small action (such as waking up in the morning) by any member of the Modi government causes the death of democracy in India. The passing of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 was no exception. The usual suspects went berserk with their headlines. If you take a look at the collage below, it is clear that these media editors are still driven by archaic language from the year 1885.However, the reasons they have given this time as a justification for their archaic rants will blow your mind. A good summary of their rants was provided by The Hindu. Wanting to stand out from the crowd, The Hindu published a detailed article under the section “FAQ” with an innocent headline – “Will new telecom bill streamline the sector?”. And to make life easy for us, they summarized the reason why all English media editors have yet again declared the death of democracy in India. First, the Telecommunications Act, 2023 is draconian. Why? Because – wait for it – it DOES NOT allow users to furnish false particulars while obtaining telecom services. The largest group that is impacted by this draconian provision is the journalists. I am not saying it – The Hindu has graciously told us the same. India is perhaps the only country in the world where democracy dies a thousand deaths every day because of laws that don’t allow people to lie, cheat and fabricate. And since journalists have descended from a different universe, they reserve all rights to “furnish false particulars” under the garb of doing their job. I often wonder if these people even read what they write! The “draconian” bill apparently also provides for “legal architecture for mass surveillance and internet shutdowns”. Notice the use of complicated language such as “legal architecture” just to sound highly intellectual! What “mass surveillance” are we talking about here? According to The Hindu’s own article, we are looking at the “controversy surrounding Pegasus targetting 300 mobile phone numbers…”. First of all, the Pegasus story has turned out to be a fake one. Assuming it is true – we are looking at a whopping 300 phone numbers in a population of 140 crores! Second of all, the government has no role in private software being used for “illegal surveillance”, so it is best left to your imagination what “mass surveillance” The Hindu and their ilk are talking about. Their arguments on the Internet Shutdown are even more nauseating. While The Hindu’s article focussed only on the Internet shutdowns in Manipur and J&K, their soul sister, The Wire, went ahead and told us that India already has the highest number of Internet shutdowns in the world, and additionally referred to Rajasthan and Odisha too. Well, guess what? When it comes to maintaining law and order, governments all over the world have extraordinary powers to ensure peace. Bill or no bill, state and central governments already have the power to order Internet Shutdowns in the interest of public safety, whether you like it or not. Going by the administrative scale of India’s area and population, what we have seen are minuscule shutdowns focussed on small areas (except for Manipur and J&K). External Affairs minister, S. Jaishankar summarized the situation aptly, in his inimitable style – “Now, if you’ve reached the stage where you say an internet cut is more dangerous than the loss of human lives, then what can I say?”He is right. These people do not value human life. They just want to encourage more violence under the garb of freedom of speech and fundamental rights. These people speak as if the internet has never been used for destructive purposes and feign shock when told otherwise. At one stage, it looks like these people realise that their arguments are not being understood by normal folks. So they come up with a stunning argument to create scare amongst people – sample this snippet from The Wire. First of all, they make it sound like a KYC document is equivalent to you writing your property in the name of WhatsApp! Second and most importantly, at no place is it told that KYC is needed for WhatsApp or similar applications. The ministry has even removed the references to OTT applications from this act because they are covered in the IT Act, of 2000. Again, if the government wants to ban or control any apk, OTT or otherwise, it doesn’t need this particular Telecommunication Act! There are enough laws that give it leeway to take such actions. If anything, this Act brings in much-needed structural changes to how the industry is governed. Certain key demands of the industry and citizens have been incorporated into the Act, thus making it easier for the industry to flourish. Significant amongst such provisions are spectrum auctions for telecom but allocations for satellite communications; the mandate of Do Not Disturb to help us from spam and scam calls; ease of deploying telecom infrastructure on private properties etc. The English media has yet again failed to provide an accurate assessment of an important legislation. As is their wont, they have fallen back on archaic arguments expecting the people to lap them up.

"22 December, 2023 ",Delhi Police’s bizarre argument in an attempt to shield Rahul Gandhi after he revealed identity of minor victim leaves many shocked: How they are...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/delhi-polices-argument-shield-rahul-gandhi-revealed-identity-of-minor-victim-delhi-crematorium-rape-murder/,"Essentially, the Delhi Police told the court that there was no evidence to prove that the 9-year-old Dalit girl was raped and murdered, and since the original crime has not been proved, Rahul Gandhi committed no crime by revealing the identity of the minor victim by publicly revealing the identity of her family. On 22nd December 2023, Rahul Gandhi gave an undertaking to the court agreeing to delete his tweet where he had revealed the identity of a minor victim in his attempt to politicise the 2021 Delhi rape and murder case. In August 2021, a 9-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped and murdered inside a crematorium. Days after the news, Rahul Gandhi had visited the parents of the victim. Thereafter, the Congress leader and his party published pictures and videos revealing the identity of the family of the victim. After the tweet by Rahul Gandhi, NCPCR took cognisance of the offence committed and wrote to social media platforms to take the tweet down. The NCPCR informed Twitter that Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 prohibits the disclosure of the identity of a minor in any form of media and Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012 also stated that no information or photo of a minor should be published in any form of media that revealed the identity of the minor. According to the complaint, the tweets put out by Rahul Gandhi shared certain personal details about the victim violating Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2012, and Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act,2015. Hence, the NCPCR asked Twitter to remove the tweets put out by Rahul Gandhi as it was a deprivation and a violation of child rights.Thereafter, Rahul Gandhi’s tweet had been restricted in India, while in the rest of the world, his tweet was visible. The current case in the Delhi High Court stems from a plea moved by Makarand Suresh Mhadlekar where he pleaded that the tweet by Rahul Gandhi violated provisions of the JJ Act and POCSO Act. While it may seem like Rahul Gandhi was merely following the law by agreeing to take his Tweet down, the truth is far from it. The High Court bench had essentially urged Rahul Gandhi to delete the tweet revealing the identity of the minor victim as it said it did not want to pass a judicial order against him. Essentially, the court told Rahul Gandhi that unless he deletes his tweet, the court will pass an order forcing him to comply. It was after this that Rahul Gandhi submitted an undertaking, agreeing to remove posts where he revealed the identity of the minor victim. The Delhi High Court further instructed the Delhi Police to file a status report in the matter of filing an FIR against Rahul Gandhi in the next 4 weeks and posted the matter for 24th of January 2024. While the High Court instructed the Delhi Police to file a status report, the conduct of the police and the arguments it presented in court were nothing short of bizarre. During the hearing, the Delhi Police on Thursday made arguments that left many shell-shocked. The arguments aimed to shield Rahul Gandhi and absolve him of culpability after he revealed the identity of a minor victim. In court, the counsel for Delhi Police in the matter, Santosh Kumar Tripathi, told the court that the investigation against Rahul Gandhi was underway and there was “a lot of complexity in the matter”. Further, the Delhi Police shockingly informed the High Court that the victim was not raped or murdered but died due to electrocution. If this assertion by the Delhi Police was not shocking enough, the Delhi Police went a step further. When asked about the status of the investigation against Rahul Gandhi and the filing of the FIR, the Delhi Police asserted that “unless the first part is proved, which is the main crime, subsequent circulation of anything on Twitter is not a crime. The purpose of Delhi Police is not to scandalise anyone”. Essentially, the Delhi Police told the court that there was no evidence to prove that the 9-year-old Dalit girl was raped and murdered, and since the original crime has not been proved, Rahul Gandhi committed no crime by revealing the identity of the minor victim by publicly revealing the identity of her family. Let us keep in mind here that the Delhi Cantonment case of this alleged rape and murder was a wildly politicised one. After the news of the alleged crime broke, Rahul Gandhi travelled to meet the victim’s parents, there were several protests, and the usual tropes about a “priest” raping and killing a Dalit child were furthered to create disaffection against the Hindu community at large by furthering the caste narrative. In 2021, the Delhi Police said that the child did not die of electrocution as claimed by the accused, but was raped and murdered. In the chargesheet, relying largely on the disclosure statements by the accused, the Delhi Police named 55-year-old Radhey Shyam, the priest of the crematorium in South-West Delhi, and other employees – Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmad and Laxmi Narayan, as the accused. The chargesheet claimed that there was sufficient evidence against them.As per its press release in 2021, the Delhi Police gathered scientific and technical evidence apart from recording testimonies of witnesses before filing its charge sheet. Assistance was taken from the Forensic Science Laboratory, Rohini as well as Delhi Police’s forensic experts on biology and odontology. Forensic psychologists were also engaged during the interrogation of the accused, the Delhi Police stated. Now, 2.5 years after a 400 page chargesheet was filed in the case claiming that there was sufficient evidence against the 4 accused, the Delhi Police, in a case related to Rahul Gandhi, stated in court yesterday that they had reached the conclusion that there was no rape and murder in the case. While this revelation was shocking enough, what was far more astounding was the argument that the Delhi Police took, based on this revelation, to shield Rahul Gandhi. In court, the Delhi Police claimed that since they had concluded that there was no forensic evidence to prove rape and murder, Rahul Gandhi had broken no laws by revealing the victim’s identity. The Delhi Police’s argument that because 2.5 years after the FIR was filed, they have concluded that no rape or murder took place, Rahul Gandhi had not broken any law by revealing the identity of the minor victim is legally an unsound opinion. The law has been established as far as the identity of the minor victim is concerned and it has nothing to do with the eventual conviction or acquittal of the accused. This is to say that the eventual outcome of the case in the court of law has no bearing on whether the identity of the minor victim can be revealed or not. Regardless of the outcome, revealing the identity is in contravention of the law. If the Delhi Police’s argument is to be accepted, then it would mean that till the case reaches its conclusion, which may take years, any individual including the media is free to circulate the identity of the minor victim. This would be against natural justice and the very purpose for which these laws against the revelation of identity have been put in place. The reason the law prohibits the circulation of the identity of a minor victim, regardless of the acquittal or conviction, is because it stigmatises the minor victim. The stigma attached to their identity being revealed is not dependent on the conclusion of the case or evidence of the crime. There are several laws, provisions and guidelines that prove that the Delhi Police’s position in the case of Rahul Gandhi is legally unsound. Prohibition on disclosure of the identity of children.(1) No report in any newspaper, magazine, news sheet or audio-visual media or other forms of communication regarding any inquiry or investigation or judicial procedure, shall disclose the name, address school or any other particular, which may lead to the identification of a child in conflict with the law or a child in need of care and protection or a child victim or witness of a crime, involved in such matter, under any other law for the time being in force, nor shall the picture of any such child be published: Provided that for reasons to be recorded i.n writing, the Board or Committee, as the case may be, holding the inquiry may permit such disclosure, if in its opinion such disclosure is in the best interest of the child.(2) The Police shall not disclose any record of the child for the purpose of character certificate or otherwise in cases where the case has been closed or disposed of.(3) Any person contravening the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or fine which may extend to two lakh rupees or both.”Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 makes it amply clear that under no circumstances would the identity of a minor victim or even a minor witness of a crime, will be revealed. The law says that no detail that could lead to the identification of the minor victim or witness shall be published in any medium – this would include the identity of the parents of the victim – a detail which was publicised by Rahul Gandhi in the given case. The law provides that contravention of this act would attract a jail sentence of up to 6 months. (1) No person shall make any report or present comments on any child from any form of media or studio or photographic facilities without having complete and authentic information, which may have the effect of lowering his reputation or infringing upon his privacy.(2) No reports in any media shall disclose, the identity of a child including his name, address, photograph, family details, school, neighbourhood or any other particulars which may lead to disclosure of the identity of the child: Provided that for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Special Court, competent to try the case under the Act, may permit such disclosure, if in its opinion such disclosure is in the interest of the child.(3) The publisher or owner of the media or studio or photographic facilities shall be jointly and severally liable for the acts and omissions of his employee.(4) Any person who contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) shall be liable to be punished with imprisonment of either description for a period which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to one year or with fine or with both.”Section 23 of the POCSO Act, 2021 also makes it clear that any circulation of identifiable information, which includes the family details of the minor victim, is punishable by no less than 6 months in jail, which could extend up to 1 year. While this rule mentions the media, it also extends to individuals such as Rahul Gandhi. “Whoever prints or publishes the name or any matter which may make known the identity of any person against whom an offence under section 376. section 376A, section 376B, section 376C or section 376D is alleged or found to have been committed (hereafter in this section referred to as the victim) shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine.”Section 228A of the IPC talks about the illegality of disclosing the identity of a victim of sexual assault. While this law is not specifically made for minor victims, it extends to all victims of sexual assault, including minors. The Nipun Saxena v. Union of India case is set strict guidelines to be followed regarding the identity of victims of sexual assault. These guidelines are widely accepted as the standard in such cases. The court in this case set out: 1. No person can print or publish in print, electronic, social media, etc. the name of the victim or even in a remote manner disclose any facts which can lead to the victim being identified and which should make her identity known to the public at large.2. In cases where the victim is dead or of unsound mind the name of the victim or her identity should not be disclosed even under the authorization of the next of kin, unless circumstances justifying the disclosure of her identity exist, which shall be decided by the competent authority, which at present is the Sessions Judge.In the Nipun Saxena case, the court makes it clear further that no individual can disclose the identity of the rape victim or any information that can lead to her identity being known to the public at large, which is exactly what Rahul Gandhi did. In none of these laws or precedents, does the conclusion of the case have any bearing, which is to say, in none of these laws or precedents does it say that an individual is permitted to disclose the identity of the victim and it would not be considered a crime if eventually, the accused are acquitted. It is, therefore, shocking that the Delhi Police would in court make such an argument that is not supported by the established law of the land. The only conclusion which explains the Delhi Police and its advocate’s argument is that this was a shoddy attempt at shielding Rahul Gandhi from the repercussions of his action since it is evident that he did not want a judicial order to this effect on his record. There are several questions that arise from the conduct of the Delhi Police and its counsel in the Rahul Gandhi matter. These questions have bewildered even those in the know of the case and close to the investigation against Rahul Gandhi. A senior advocate on the condition of anonymity claimed that the Delhi Police’s argument in court had shocked everyone and it made no legal sense. “It would appear that the case is being botched up either way to shield Rahul Gandhi”, he said. Another close to MHA, under whom the Delhi Police falls, said that they would be looking into the matter and ensuring that the investigation is not being compromised for political reasons.

"21 December, 2023 ",The erosion of democratic decorum: Opposition’s unruly conduct in Parliament threatens the integrity of the democratic process,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/opposition-unruly-conduct-parliament-integrity-democratic-process/,"Opposition decided to engage in mockery, sloganeering and unruly behaviour that cast a dark shadow on the democratic ideals that define our great nation.The security breach in the Lok Sabha on 13th December 2023 was a highly concerning event, especially on the anniversary of the deadly 2001 parliament attack. While the security breach is under investigation, the opposition’s response to it has lacked decorum and has raised serious apprehensions about the sanctity of the democratic process.In the aftermath, the opposition followed the path of slogan-shouting, hooliganism and blatant disregard for the established parliamentary norms. Sadly, the opposition leaders brought placards to the House even though they promised not to do so in the meeting with Speaker Om Birla.There is no doubt that the opposition plays a vital role in the democratic setup. The opposition serves as a necessary check on the ruling party, and ensures that the decisions made by the central government undergo scrutiny. However, how the opposition chose to behave in the House following the security breach raises grave concerns about the integrity of the parliamentary proceedings.To maintain the decorum of the House, the Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairperson had to suspend over 140 Members of the Parliament from both Houses. In a democracy, constructive debates are the bedrock of informed governance. Only through the debates in the House do the proposed bills get subjected to the much-needed examination. The debates and proposed amendments help formulate robust and comprehensive laws that benefit all sections of society. However, it is regrettable that the recent events in both Houses showcased a blatant disregard for the democratic process as the opposition continued to obstruct the functioning of the parliament.Notably, Lok Sabha passed significant bills such as Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Sakshhya (Second) Bill 2023, and The Telecommunications Bill, 2023 on 20th December 2023. Sadly, a significant portion of the opposition was missing from the House as they were suspended due to the disruptive behaviour. The ruling party in the House faced a difficult choice. Still, they had no option but to proceed without the participation of the opposition leaders to ensure the legislative process continued.In the last 9.5 years since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took charge at the Centre, the country has progressed in every section. The government’s dedication towards nation-building and its unwavering commitment to a better future for the citizens is commendable. However, in stark contrast, the opposition has persistently attempted to impede these efforts. Their behaviour raises serious questions about their priorities and allegiance to the welfare of the people of Bharat.Furthermore, the unwarranted mocking of Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar by TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee added an even more troubling dimension to the conduct of the opposition. His behaviour undermined the dignity of the parliamentary proceedings and set a dangerous path for the future. The Vice President, as the Chair of the Rajya Sabha, symbolises the highest level of parliamentary authority, and such attempts to belittle the office are a direct assault on the democratic principles of the country. The matter was so concerning that the President of India had to step in and express her dismay over the unwarranted mockery of the Vice President. Bharat is heading towards the Lok Sabha Elections 2024. The voters are now at a critical decision-making juncture. It is essential to examine the conduct of the political parties and their representatives, especially in times of crisis. Hooliganism, slogan-shouting, and an utter lack of decorum have no place in the esteemed halls of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.Undoubtedly, the events of 13th December 2023 highlighted a concerning lapse in security. However, instead of supporting the security agencies and the government to weed out the loopholes, the opposition decided to engage in mockery, sloganeering and unruly behaviour that cast a dark shadow on the democratic ideals that define our great nation. Voters must meticulously evaluate the conduct of elected representatives. The representatives in the Parliament must be held accountable.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"26 December, 2023 ","Alt News’ Mohammed Zubair spreads fake claims that Anju Bobby George joined BJP, yet to delete after multiple fact-checks",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/alt-news-md-zubair-spreads-fake-news-anju-bobby-george-yest-to-delete-after-multiple-fact-checks/,"Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Murlaeedharan also refuted the claims that Anju joined the BJP. Speaking to the Indian Express then, he had said he has had a long association with Anju and her husband, Robert Bobby George and Anju was at the event just to meet him.On 25th December, Alt News’ co-founder out-on-bail Mohammed Zubair targetted former athlete Anju Bobby George for praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In a social media post, he claimed that mainstream media reports mentioned that she praised PM Modi but did not mention that she joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019. In the post, he wrote, “ANI forgot to mention that BJP member Anju George joined the party in 2019” and shared two screenshots from ANI. One from 23rd December, where ANI shared a video of Anju praising PM Modi, and the second from July 2019, where ANI mistakenly claimed Anju joined the BJP.Zubair, who claims to be the ‘messiah’ of fact-checking, failed to fact-check if Anju joined the BJP. On 6th July, Anju Bobby George attended an event where BJP Karnataka President BS Yeddyurappa was present. In a post on X (then-Twitter), ANI wrote, “Anju Bobby George, India’s first athletics medallist at the World Championship, joins BJP in the presence of Karnataka BJP President BS Yeddyurappa.”However, the report was incorrect, and Anju refuted the claims that she had no political aspirations. Speaking to the media, she said, “I had gone there just to meet the minister (V Muraleedharan), a family friend. When the BJP leaders saw me standing near the stage, they called me on stage and greeted me with the flag. They did not even know that I was present at the function. Sports is my party, and I have no intention of joining any party.”Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Murlaeedharan also refuted the claims that Anju joined the BJP. Speaking to the Indian Express, he said he has had a long association with Anju and her husband, Robert Bobby George. When he went to a party programme in Bengaluru, Anju called and asked to meet, to which he agreed. “When she came to the programme where I was taking part, the event was about to begin. So I invited her to the dais, as she is an internationally acclaimed athlete.”Notably, a statement by Karnataka BJP media convener S Shantaram also created confusion in the matter as he slammed her for saying that she did not join the party. He had said, “She came on stage, took the party flag & our state President announced she joined the BJP. Don’t know why she changed stand. Doesn’t she know the meaning of taking the flag on stage from the president?” Later, he told BOOM there was some miscommunication as she came to the dias and accepted the flag. However, when BOOM contacted Anju, she categorically refuted the claims that she had joined the BJP and clarified that she only went to meet the minister.Interestingly, Zubair, according to the left liberals, who is the “poster boy” of fact-checking, did not correct his fake post even after multiple fact-checks. Replying to Zubair, Ankur Singh wrote, “Why are you spreading Fake News even after four years? She never joined the BJP. Anju and BJP both clarified on the same day. There were several fact checks too. But why will you show the truth?”Why are you spreading Fake News even after 4 years?She never joined BJP. Anju and BJP both had clarified the same day.There were several fact checks too. But why will you show the truth? pic.twitter.com/5RDpBne1f3In a post, X user Mr Sinha fact-checked Zubair and wrote, “Anju Bobby George never joined BJP, it was cleared in 2019 itself and yet this guy who calls every other person fake news peddler & himself a fact checker sharing fake news…”Anju Bobby George never joined BJP, it was cleared in 2019 itself and yet this guy who calls every other person fake news peddler & himself a fact checker sharing fake news… pic.twitter.com/xPuDZpvTFnThe most interesting thing is that one of Zubair’s favourite media houses, Maktoob Media, also fact-checked whether Anju joined the BJP or not 2019 and came to the conclusion that the reports were false. In a way, Maktoob Media’s 2019 fact-check fact-checked Alt News’ Mohammed Zubair in 2023. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"21 December, 2023 ","‘Fact-Checker’ Md Zubair spreads fake news after Sanjay Singh wins election to become WFI president, claims he was ‘appointed’ by BJP",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-checker-md-zubair-spreads-fake-news-that-sanjay-singh-was-appointed-as-wfi-president-by-bjp/,"BJP or any political party, or even the government, can’t appoint the WFI president, or any head of any sporting federation in the country. Any interference in running sporting bodies results in the suspension of such a body by respective parent global body. The protesting wrestlers led by Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia, and Vinesh Phogat faced a massive setback after former Commonwealth Games Gold medallist Anita Sheoran lost the election for the post of the president of the Wrestling Federations of India (WFI). Sheoran, who was supported by the protesting wrestlers, was defeated by Sanjay Singh, who is close to former president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.Unhappy with the results of the election, Sakshi Malik has announced that she is retiring from the sport because Sanjay Singh is allegedly a business partner of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. She said in a press conference, “If somebody like Sanjay Singh, who is a business partner and friend of Brij Bhushan Singh is elected as the new president, I am quitting wrestling.”As Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is a BJP MP, left-liberals are already attacking the BJP over Sanjay Singh becoming the new WFI president. However, ‘fact-checker’ and Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair went ahead, claiming that Sanjay Singh was appointed to the sports body by BJP, and he was not elected.Quoting an ANI tweet showing Sakshi Malik breaking while exiting the press conference, Md Zubair tweeted, “Tweet like BJP: 60+ crore Indian Women insulted by BJP by appointing Former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s close Aid as the new president of Wrestling Federation of India.”While he was trying to take on BJP’s claim that the opposition insulted the Jat community by doing a mimicry on Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, he resorted to using false claims in the tweet. Zubair claimed that the BJP appointed Sharan Singh as the new president of Wrestling Federation of India. He said that Sanjay Singh is a close aide of former WFI chief and sexual harassment accused Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, trying to imply that it should disqualify him from the post.It is obvious that BJP or any political party, or even the government, can’t appoint the WFI president, or any head of any sporting federation in the country. Any interference in running sporting bodies, including the selection of officials, results in the suspension of such a body by the parent global body. In fact, WFI is already suspended by United World Wrestling for not holding the elections on time, and now that suspension is expected to be lifted.Sanjay Singh has been elected as the new WFI president, he was not ‘appointed’ to the post as alleged by Islamist propagandist Zubair. The election is held as per Model Election Guidelines of the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sport. The details of how elections are conducted as mentioned in the WFI constitution.As per Article IV of the constitution, All State Wrestling Associations and Union Territory Wrestling Associations are entitled to send 2 Representatives to the General Council. Each Representative have one vote.Accordingly, the elections for 15 posts of the WFI including the president were held in Delhi on 21st December. Besides president, elections were held for the posts of a senior vice-president, four vice-presidents, a secretary general, a treasurer, two joint secretaries and five executive members. Out of a total of 47 votes, Sanjay Singh got 40 votes, while Anita Sheoran received only 7 votes. Reportedly, candidates in Brish Bhushan’s camp won 13 out of the 15 positions. Therefore, it can’t be even claimed that federations in BJP-ruled states voted for Singh, because there are more than 7 states where non-BJP parties are in power. This clearly shows that a majority of the members voted for Singh, while the support for Sheoran, supported by protesting wrestlers, is very low.However, these facts do not bother ‘fact-checker’ Zubair to claim that Sanjay Singh has been appointed as WFI president by the BJP.The election of a new president means that the suspension of WFI by the global wrestling body United World Wrestling will be lifted.

"18 December, 2023 ","‘Islam is incompatible with Europian culture’: 5-year-old video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni goes viral, reported as recent statement",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/islam-is-incompatible-with-europian-culture-5-year-old-video-of-italian-pm-giorgia-meloni-goes-viral-fact-check/,"In the video, Meloni is seen saying, ""Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.""on 17th and 18th December, a video of Italian PM Giorgia Meloni went viral on social media. As per the subtitles in the video, she was seen saying that Islam is not compatible with European values and culture. Islam is being perpetrated (in Italy) through Saudi Arabia’s funding and Saudi Arabia has Sharia law. Meloni further says that the Sharia law is not compatible with Europian values and culture. The whole of Europe is being Islamised.There is no similarity between our culture and Islam.Islam is being spread by Saudi in Italy.There is Sharia law in Saudi, which we will not allow to be implemented in Italy.: Georgia Meloni, PM, Italy pic.twitter.com/uCqYhpodBuThe same alleged statement was reported by a number of media houses, mostly Indian.

A number of Indian media houses including WION, Hindustan Times, Mint, NDTV, and Times Now reported the same claims. NDTV used a X post embed of a handle named Geopolitical Kid and wrote that Meloni’s statement was given during the political event organised by her party. However, Meloni’s statement regarding Islam’s alleged incompatibility wasn’t found in any international publications in the last 24-hour window. Radio Genoa, a popular handle on X, seemed to have first posted the video. Italian PM Giorgia Meloni: “I believe that there is a problem of compatibility between Islamic culture and the values ​​and rights of our civilization. The Islamic cultural centers in Italy are financed by Saudi Arabia where Sharia is in force. In Europe there is a very… pic.twitter.com/wEn8Fl4JC2However, Radio Genoa has not cited a time frame, and has not written that Meloni’s statement was recent. Upon searching with the keywords and comparing it with Meloni’s video clip going viral, we found that the original video was posted on YouTube back in 2018. The video was posted by the YouTube channel alanews in 2018. The original video can be seen here. In the video, Meloni is seen saying, “Salvini says that Islam is incompatible with the constitution? Ask him for clarification, but I believe that Islam certainly presents incompatibility with our values ​​and our civilization, and what happens in Islamic centers demonstrates this. This does not mean generalizing, but there is an incompatibility with our culture.”In that video, Meloni was referring to a previous statement by another conservative leader Matteo Salvini. Salvini, referring to the Cologne mass sexual attacks and Berlin terrorist attack, had said that Islam is incompatible with European values. Salvni is a leader of Italy’s Lega Nord party. Conclusion: While the viral video of Giorgia Meloni is mostly correct in rough translation, the video, or the statement, are not recent. They are from 5 years ago, and not from the recent political event organised by Meloni’s party. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"18 December, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did Pakistani caretaker PM confirm that unknown men poisoned Dawood Ibrahim? Here is the truth,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/fact-check-pakistani-caretaker-pm-dawood-ibrahim-death-confirmation/,"Dawood Ibrahim was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. On Monday (18th December), social media was abuzz with rumours of the death of wanted terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, who has been hiding in Pakistan for decades. As per the rumours, Ibrahim was poisoned by an unknown person, and he was rushed to hospital. Some posts on social media claimed he was critical, while others claimed that he died. The rumours began spreading on Sunday (17th December) after Pakistan’s internet went down.Amid the rumours, an alleged screenshot of caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar Ul Haq Kakar, went viral on social media with claims that the said post confirmed the death of Ibrahim. The post read, “The Messiah of humanity, dear to every Pakistani heart, our beloved His Excellency Dawood Ibrahim passed away due to poisoned by unknown. He breathed his last in a hospital in Karachi. May Allah grant him the highest position in Jannat. Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.”However, when OpIndia investigated the screenshot and the official handle of the Pakistani PM, we found that there was no such tweet. Furthermore, the handle used in the screenshot was anwaar_kakkar, while the real ID of the Pakistani PM is anwaar_kakar. There is a handle called anwaar_kakkar, but that is a fan account of PM Kakar, and there was no such tweet either. It was evident that someone artificially created the post by adding text and a Grey Verified Check Mark on the fan account.Pakistani journalists also fuelled the rumours. In a recent episode of Bheja Fry, Pakistani journalist Aarzoo Kazmi talked about the rumours surrounding the poisoning of Dawood Ibrahim and his critical health in the hospital. She highlighted the fact that there was an internet shutdown in the country and emphasised that something was happening in Pakistan. She also talked about the rumours of Dawood Ibrahim’s poisoning and critical health. While she fanned the rumours, the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed.As per Aaj Tak, Ibrahim was indeed admitted to the hospital two days back. It is unclear what was the reason, but several reports talked about the rumours of him being poisoned.Though the rumours of Ibrahim’s death remained unconfirmed, it was indeed a fact that internet services faced a massive crackdown in Pakistan on 17th December. Social media services and search engines stopped working without any prior notice. No one could access social media platforms like X, Facebook, YouTube, etc., and the Google search engine was down. While it was rumoured that the crackdown was because of the poisoning of Ibrahim, in reality, it appeared that the Pakistani government shut down the internet to limit the access and circulation of videos of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s virtual rally.Dawood Ibrahim is one of the most notorious and dreaded gangsters that India has ever seen. A criminal mobster and drug dealer in Mumbai. It is believed that he now resides in Karachi, Pakistan. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million for his capture for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, the FBI and Forbes named him number three on The World’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives.While Ibrahim’s death rumours are all over social media, it has to be noted that such rumours find their place on social media platforms once or twice every year. It is a fact that Ibrahim is hiding in Pakistan, and the hostile neighbour categorically refused to accept his presence in the country.OpIndia’s detailed report on terrorists being killed by unnamed assailants in Pakistan can be checked here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 December, 2023 ",HC rejects India Today’s plea against govt order asking them to run apology scroll for showing liquor ads: Details,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/delhi-high-court-tv-today-mib-order-apology-scrolls-liquor-ads/,"The MIB ordered TV Today to run an apology scroll at the bottom of the monitor four times a day between 9 AM and 9 PM for three straight days for broadcasting advertisements for 100 Pipers Music CDs and All Seasons Club Soda on its news channels.The Delhi High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by TV Today Network (which runs news channels Aaj Tak and India Today among others) challenging a Central Government order asking the media network to run apologies scrolls for broadcasting liquor commercials on its news channels.Justice Subramonium Prasad dismissed the petition, stating that TV Today had broken Rule 7 (Advertising Code) of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994, by displaying the ‘100 Pipers’ logo while advertising 100 Pipers Music CDs.“The display of the logo of ‘100 Pipers’ would thus appear to be in contravention of that Rule. Since the provisions of Rule 7 have not been complied with, the contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that they had proceeded in good faith based on the CBFC [Central Board of Film Certification] certificate which was submitted by the advertiser cannot be accepted as the Rules do not permit the broadcaster to independently ascertain the veracity of the clip that is provided by the advertiser,” the Court observed.As per Rule 7(1)(2)(viii)(A) of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994, “Advertising carried in the cable service shall be so designed as to conform to the laws of the country and should not offend morality, decency and religious susceptibilities of the subscribers.” Further, the law does not allow any advertisement that promotes directly or indirectly the production, sale, or consumption of cigarettes, tobacco products, wine, alcohol, liquor, or other intoxicants (subject to conditions). Concerning the running of the ‘All Seasons Club Soda’ advertisement, the Court determined that it was not even certified by the CBFC. The order was issued after TV Today filed a petition with the High Court challenging a Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) order dated 14th June 2022.The MIB ordered TV Today to run an apology scroll at the bottom of the monitor four times a day between 9 AM and 9 PM for three straight days for broadcasting advertisements for 100 Pipers Music CDs and All Seasons Club Soda on its news channels.TV Today maintained that, in the case of the ‘100 Pipers’ broadcast, the clip was aired based on the CBFC certificate, which was provided by the advertiser.Regarding the ‘All Seasons Club Soda’ broadcast, it was stated that the brand name ‘All Seasons’ is commonly used by a variety of products other than a liquor brand.The counsel maintained that the MIB orders should be overturned because the channel was not supposed to compare the clips provided by the advertiser with those certified by the CBFC before airing them. The media outlet had acted in good faith, the court was informed. Justice Prasad, however, rejected these arguments. “On a perusal of the clip and the screenshots that were produced, it is clearly evident that what was broadcast would not satisfy the well-recognized attributes of surrogate advertising. This clip admittedly was also not certified by CBFC. A visual examination of that clip would lead one to the irresistible conclusion that what was in fact being directly advertised was a prohibited product. The petitioner has thus clearly failed to act with prudence and care insofar as the broadcast of that particular clip is concerned,” the order dated 19th December read. “In view of the above, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the Orders dated 14.06.2022, passed by the Competent Authority, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting,” the High Court concluded.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"25 December, 2023 ","According to The Hindu, democracy has died yet again after the passage of the Telecom Bill. Why? Because it won’t allow journalists to lie...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/telecommunication-bill-the-hindu-leftist-criticism-journalists/,"The English media has yet again failed to provide an accurate assessment of an important legislation. As is their wont, they have fallen back on archaic arguments expecting the people to lap them up. The people have done well to ignore them.Bharat’s Parliament approved the Telecommunications Bill, 2023 in the recently concluded winter session. This act will now replace three archaic laws from the years 1885, 1933, and 1950. You read the years right. They are not a typo. Up until now, we were still governed by laws passed in 1885 too!  According to the English media, democracy is either in danger in India or has already died in India. Any small action (such as waking up in the morning) by any member of the Modi government causes the death of democracy in India. The passing of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 was no exception. The usual suspects went berserk with their headlines. If you take a look at the collage below, it is clear that these media editors are still driven by archaic language from the year 1885.However, the reasons they have given this time as a justification for their archaic rants will blow your mind. A good summary of their rants was provided by The Hindu. Wanting to stand out from the crowd, The Hindu published a detailed article under the section “FAQ” with an innocent headline – “Will new telecom bill streamline the sector?”. And to make life easy for us, they summarized the reason why all English media editors have yet again declared the death of democracy in India. First, the Telecommunications Act, 2023 is draconian. Why? Because – wait for it – it DOES NOT allow users to furnish false particulars while obtaining telecom services. The largest group that is impacted by this draconian provision is the journalists. I am not saying it – The Hindu has graciously told us the same. India is perhaps the only country in the world where democracy dies a thousand deaths every day because of laws that don’t allow people to lie, cheat and fabricate. And since journalists have descended from a different universe, they reserve all rights to “furnish false particulars” under the garb of doing their job. I often wonder if these people even read what they write! The “draconian” bill apparently also provides for “legal architecture for mass surveillance and internet shutdowns”. Notice the use of complicated language such as “legal architecture” just to sound highly intellectual! What “mass surveillance” are we talking about here? According to The Hindu’s own article, we are looking at the “controversy surrounding Pegasus targetting 300 mobile phone numbers…”. First of all, the Pegasus story has turned out to be a fake one. Assuming it is true – we are looking at a whopping 300 phone numbers in a population of 140 crores! Second of all, the government has no role in private software being used for “illegal surveillance”, so it is best left to your imagination what “mass surveillance” The Hindu and their ilk are talking about. Their arguments on the Internet Shutdown are even more nauseating. While The Hindu’s article focussed only on the Internet shutdowns in Manipur and J&K, their soul sister, The Wire, went ahead and told us that India already has the highest number of Internet shutdowns in the world, and additionally referred to Rajasthan and Odisha too. Well, guess what? When it comes to maintaining law and order, governments all over the world have extraordinary powers to ensure peace. Bill or no bill, state and central governments already have the power to order Internet Shutdowns in the interest of public safety, whether you like it or not. Going by the administrative scale of India’s area and population, what we have seen are minuscule shutdowns focussed on small areas (except for Manipur and J&K). External Affairs minister, S. Jaishankar summarized the situation aptly, in his inimitable style – “Now, if you’ve reached the stage where you say an internet cut is more dangerous than the loss of human lives, then what can I say?”He is right. These people do not value human life. They just want to encourage more violence under the garb of freedom of speech and fundamental rights. These people speak as if the internet has never been used for destructive purposes and feign shock when told otherwise. At one stage, it looks like these people realise that their arguments are not being understood by normal folks. So they come up with a stunning argument to create scare amongst people – sample this snippet from The Wire. First of all, they make it sound like a KYC document is equivalent to you writing your property in the name of WhatsApp! Second and most importantly, at no place is it told that KYC is needed for WhatsApp or similar applications. The ministry has even removed the references to OTT applications from this act because they are covered in the IT Act, of 2000. Again, if the government wants to ban or control any apk, OTT or otherwise, it doesn’t need this particular Telecommunication Act! There are enough laws that give it leeway to take such actions. If anything, this Act brings in much-needed structural changes to how the industry is governed. Certain key demands of the industry and citizens have been incorporated into the Act, thus making it easier for the industry to flourish. Significant amongst such provisions are spectrum auctions for telecom but allocations for satellite communications; the mandate of Do Not Disturb to help us from spam and scam calls; ease of deploying telecom infrastructure on private properties etc. The English media has yet again failed to provide an accurate assessment of an important legislation. As is their wont, they have fallen back on archaic arguments expecting the people to lap them up.

"23 December, 2023 ","Favouritism, allowing harassment of women at the workplace, exploitation: How Left ecosystem shielded author of the book on Rahul Gandhi",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/allegations-of-favouritism-sexual-abuse-serial-lying-how-left-ecosystem-shielded-rahul-gandhi-book-author/,"After Dayashankar Mishra's resignation, several reports citing News 18 employees have accused the author of a book on Rahul Gandhi of after his resignation, many reports citing employees in News18 have accused him of favouritism, castism, sexual abuse, unprofessional behaviour and other allegations.On 22nd November 2023, Dayashankar Mishra resigned from News18. He claimed in his X post that he was forced to resign because he wrote a book on Congress scion Rahul Gandhi. However, after his resignation, many reports citing employees in News18 have accused him of favouritism, casteism, harassment of women at the workplace, unprofessional behaviour and other allegations.Reports on Bhadas4Media have covered many such accounts of these former colleagues of Dayashankar Mishra. Mishra is also accused of compiling his book using multiple reports from various news media outlets. The News18 has also refuted his claims terming them false and misleading.In his X post, Dayashankar Mishra wrote, “I had no idea how difficult it would be to write the truth on Rahul Gandhi. At a time when there is a competition for writing stories and mythology in the ruling class, I thought why would it bother anyone to compile and present the thinking, vision and perseverance of a public thinker? But I was proved wrong. It is our job to write and express. But due to this, suddenly the company’s beats increased. I had the option of getting the book back. Keep working. Shut up. But I chose the book. We chose what is our basic task. Chose to tell the truth. Therefore, first the resignation, then the book.”पहले इस्तीफ़ा, फिर किताब :राहुल गांधी पर सच लिखना क‍ितनी मुश्‍किलें खड़ी करेगा, मुझे बिल्कुल अंदाज़ा नहीं था। ऐसे समय जब सत्‍ताधीशों पर गाथा-पुराण ल‍िखने की होड़ लगी हो, मैंने सोचा था कि एक लोकनीत‍िक व‍िचारक की सोच, दृष्टि और दृढ़ता को संकल‍ित कर प्रस्‍तुत करना क‍िसी को क्‍यों… pic.twitter.com/oEroAWRP1iAfter this post of Dayashankar Mishra, ‘News18 India’ also shared a post on X. In this post, News18 described Dayashankar Mishra’s post as misleading and baseless. In its post, News18 India said that as per the rules of the company, before writing any book or making any kind of contribution outside the organisation, employees have to get permission. This is how it is in all reputed media institutions. But Dayashankar Mishra, as editor of the Hindi website of News18, did not get permission from the organisation to write this book.News18 statement about the false and misleading claims by Mr Dayashankar Mishra: pic.twitter.com/Cuo5Jd5LRbAfter Dayashankar Mishra resigned from News18 Hindi, many of his former colleagues came ahead to share their experiences with the journalist, who for all practical purposes had become a political activist singing an ode to Rahul Gandhi. According to reports in the media, Mishra is accused of unprofessional behaviour, harassment of women at the workplace, favouritism, casteism, and cheating on the employer. They have also accused him of plagiarism in his book ‘Rahul Gandhi: Historic Struggle against Communalism, Disinformation and Dictatorship’.The book is seen as an attempt by the journalist to make inroads to the Congress party rather than his commitment to be a voice of opposition as he claims. He strategically launched the book on 22nd November when the elections were happening in 5 states. However, the book had no impact on the results as the BJP triumphed in the Hindi-speaking states where the former journalist from News18 Hindi was trying to make grounds for Congress.In various reports published on Bhadas4Media, it is claimed that Dayashankar Mishra favoured people from his caste and his relatives while recruiting new candidates in the News18 Hindi’s digital newsroom. Some of them have claimed that he would favour a certain few. Others have claimed that his book is not an original work and hardly any part is written by himself. They claim that he either used old reports from anti-Modi portals like Newslaundry and Alt News as it is or he deployed some of his juniors for this work. While doing so, Dayashankar Mishra also communicated to his seniors in News18 that these junior colleagues were working on some secret project. Therefore, he is also accused of cheating his employer.Besides, the reports also claimed that he would often ask his junior employees to do his household work and never pay serious attention to female colleagues requesting him to constitute a committee to probe their allegations against others under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace rules. Some of them even accused him of harassment at the workplace.As it completes a month to Dayashankar Mishra’s resignation from Network18, it should be noted that despite repeated allegations against him by his former colleagues, no one from the ecosystem of leftist liberal journalists and mainstream media houses has shown the courage to confront him on these issues and ask clarification from him on these allegations. Instead, his book was promoted on various platforms as he was invited to speak about this book on various web portals and their YouTube channels. This should be seen as a systematic attempt to shield a once powerful boss in the newsroom who continuously threatened his colleagues that they might lose their jobs if they went against him. Dayashankar Mishra’s whole episode should therefore be seen as an eye-opener exposing the dark side of the Left ecosystem that turns a blind eye to serious allegations of misconduct against one of their own while blowing trumpet and resorting to exaggeration against their ideological opponents.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On 18th December (Monday), the Times of India commemorated the birth anniversary of Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin describing him as ‘The Man of Steel’. Shared as a Trivia factoid, the post eulogised him with a poster listing key facets of his “leadership”.

CPI(M)’s Puducherry unit praising the Communist dictator wrote, “Comrade Joseph Stalin, born on December 18, 1878, a revolutionary Bolshevik who led the victorious Antifascist war and laid the foundation for a strong working-class state of the planet.

Looks like your newsroom is filled with Stalin fanbois from radical left universities.As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labour camps, forced collectivisation, famine and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women.In a century, communist states have killed approximately 100 million people, according to Ilya Somin’s articles. Joseph Stalin’s attempts to collectivise agriculture and production in Russia resulted in the deaths of 6 to 10 million people. Stalin imposed collective agriculture, prohibiting people from cultivating on their own, and imprisoning dissenters in Siberian labour camps. In Russia and Ukraine, millions went hungry, and hundreds of thousands died in prison camps. When Ukrainian production fell short of Stalin’s quota, he punished them even more by taking away everything they had. In Ukraine, Stalin’s forced famine is termed ‘Holodomor’ by joining the words for hunger (holod) and mor (extermination or mass-murder).Stalin’s atrocities were not restricted to the Soviet famine; he also carried out the ‘Great Purge,’ in which everyone he disapproved of was imprisoned, tortured, or executed. No one was spared, even wealthy peasants, politicians, military men, and ethnic minorities. The Purge alone is thought to have killed over 1.2 million people.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"27 December, 2023 ",‘Harappan civilisation is 7000 to 8000 years old’: Scientists studying DNA samples from Rakhigarhi site find,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/harappan-civilisation-is-7000-8000-years-old-scientists-studying-dna-samples-from-rakhigarhi-site-find/,"Shirwalkar further elaborated, ""Human ‘DNA’ has remained the same for 8,000 years which we have found during our research. When human traps were found here, they were thoroughly tested. Scientists have drawn conclusions based on this. A large burial ground was found here and it had human traps as well as animal traps.""In a major development in the study of Harappan Civilisation, the researchers from Deccan College Pune and the Central Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have found that human remains unearthed at an ancient site of Rakhigarhi – a village in the Hisar district of Haryana – date back roughly 8,000 years. The finding was made during the third round of excavations conducted by the ASI in collaboration with several teams from across the country, including Deccan College Pune researchers, Hindustan Times reported.Dr. Amarendra Nath of the Indian Archaeology Department conducted the first phase of excavations at Rakhigarhi from 1997 to 2000, during which evidence of the North Harappan culture dating back to 2500 BC was discovered. Professor Vasant Shinde of Deccan College Pune led the second round of excavations at Rakhi Garhi from 2006 to 2013, collecting evidence and conducting DNA tests to establish that this culture was possibly over 4,000 years old. The ASI and Deccan College Pune have worked together over the past two years to complete the third phase of excavations at Rakhigarhi, led by ASI joint director Sanjay Kumar Manjul and Deccan College Pune assistant professor Prabhodh Shirwalkar.Shirwalkar told HT that the Harappan culture is divided into three parts: East Harappan, Middle Harappan, and North Harappan (Modern). The previous two excavations discovered evidence of the Middle and Modern Harappan cultures stretching back about 4,000 years. However, evidence discovered during the third round of excavations indicates that the culture dates back 7,000 to 8,000 years. “The final report of the work is being prepared by our team,” Shirwalkar said adding that the research will continue for many more months.Shirwalkar further elaborated, “Human ‘DNA’ has remained the same for 8,000 years which we have found during our research. When human traps were found here, they were thoroughly tested. Scientists have drawn conclusions based on this. A large burial ground was found here and it had human traps as well as animal traps.”Shirwalkar revealed that clay pots, old silver and copper ornaments were discovered alongside utensils made of various metals, including gold and silver as well and a dinner set was discovered during the excavation. During the excavations, a large settlement of the largest ancient houses ever was found underground. A courtyard along with a drainage system were also found in it. Moreover, there were two- to six-bedroom houses that were also available at that time. The clothing fashion of the people of that time is also known. The research team found a colourful worn piece of cloth, a shawl and a skirt.“This research has found strong evidence that the Harappan civilisation is 7,000 to 8,000 years old. Scientists from the Department of Archaeology of India and Deccan College have worked together on the project. It is agreed that there was human habitation or civilisation in our country 8,000 years ago,” Shirwalkar asserted adding that the people back then were as advanced as they are in present times.Back in 2019, it was reported citing a research study that the primary source of ancestry in modern South Indians is a prehistoric genetic gradient between people related to early hunter-gatherers of Iran and Southeast Asia. In a major blow to the Aryan Invasion Theory, the research found that the skeletal remains from the Rakhigarhi individual were from a population that is “the largest source of ancestry for South Asians”.The study which involved the inspection of DNA samples of the skeletons found in Rakhigarhi, an Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) site in Haryana, found no traces of the R1a1 gene or Central Asian ‘steppe’ genes, colloquially called the ‘Aryan gene’. In 2018 as well, OpIndia reported that researchers of the DNA study of Rakhigarhi skeletal remains have stated that they found no central Asian trace.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"26 December, 2023 ",‘Felt insulted’: Groom’s family in Hyderabad calls off wedding after bride’s family fails to serve mutton bone marrow to guests,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/telangana-hyderabad-grooms-family-calls-off-wedding-after-brides-family-failed-to-include-mutton-bone-marrow-in-menu/,"The groom's family claimed that the bride's family had purposefully concealed from them that bone marrow was not on the menu. In a bizarre incident, a groom’s family in Hyderabad, Telangana called off the wedding after seeing that the girl’s family had not served mutton with bone marrow to the wedding guests. According to reports, the argument over the petty issue snowballed into a full-blown fight with the local police having to enter the scene to pacify the groom’s family. Officials from the nearby police station attempted to persuade the groom’s family out of the altercation, but they remained unrelenting, furious over what they perceived as an ‘insult.’The groom’s family claimed that the bride’s family had purposefully concealed from them that bone marrow was not on the menu. Ultimately, the engagement party ended with the groom’s family calling off the wedding.According to reports, the bride’s family was from the Nizamabad district and the groom’s family was from the Jagtial district in Telangana. The families had decided on the wedding and the engagement took place at the bride’s residence recently.The bride’s family arranged for non-vegetarian meals for the bridegroom’s family members and relatives after both families decided on a traditional and lavish wedding.Just when everything was going according to plan, one of the guests pointed out that the non-vegetarian meal did not include any bone marrow of mutton. The hosts responded by saying that they hadn’t included bone marrow in the meals, which ultimately led to an altercation between both parties and the groom’s family calling off the wedding and the bride’s side agreed. Both families then left for their respective places without any reconciliation.Interestingly, a similar incident was reported from Hyderabad in February this year wherein a man named Mohammad Zakeer had called off his wedding, claiming that the bride’s family was giving him second-hand furniture as dowry.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"23 December, 2023 ","PornHub’s parent company admits it made profit by coercing women into performing sex acts on camera and posting it without their consent, fined 1.8...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/parent-company-of-pornhub-admits-making-profit-from-sex-trafficking-fined-1-8-million-dollars/,"The accusations originate from the fact that the company hosted content and took money from a third party, Girls Do Porn (GDP).The Parent company of one of the biggest pornographic content websites in the world, PornHub, has acknowledged profiting from sex trafficking. It acknowledged having hosted adult videos in which women were forced to engage in sexual acts on camera; the business subsequently shared the videos online without the women’s consent.As part of a deferred prosecution agreement reached with federal prosecutors, Aylo, formerly known as MindGeek, would pay a fine of 1.8 million Dollars and compensate the victims of sex trafficking. Aylo, who entered a not-guilty plea to participate in illegal financial transactions involving proceeds from sex trafficking, will be under observation for three years, according to the agreement. The accusations against the corporation will be withdrawn if it abides by the conditions of the contract.The accusations originate from the fact that the company hosted content and took money from a third party, Girls Do Porn (GDP).According to court documents, Aylo continued to accept money from the GDP channel even after it was aware of sex trafficking allegations from some of the women appearing in the videos.Court records stated that Aylo failed to comply with all removal requests and independently checked consent, even after receiving requests from multiple women in 2016 and learning of federal action against the production business in 2017.The victims said that the GDP forced them to have sex on camera and misled them about how the footage would be disseminated. According to prosecutors, the company received more than $100,000 from GirlsDoPorn and roughly $764,000 in payments from advertisers attributable to the production company.In 2021, Aylo, then known as MindGeek, settled with 50 women out of court. “Aylo received money that Aylo knew or should have known was derived from the GDP Operators’ sex trafficking operations,” the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York alleged.In all, there were over 400 victims, and GDP producer Ruben Andre Garcia was given a 20-year federal jail sentence in 2021 for forcing women to appear in pornographic recordings.Later that year, the women gained the rights to the videos in which they had starred, and Garcia was forced to make amends by giving them $18 million.Notably, in the year 2020, the New York Times published an article levelling allegations that MindGeek’s sites were hosting material depicting rapes and sex involving minors.The NYT‘s 2020 article read, “Its site is infested with rape videos. It monetizes child rapes, revenge pornography, spy cam videos of women showering, racist and misogynist content, and footage of women being asphyxiated in plastic bags. A search for “girls under18” (no space) or “14yo” leads in each case to more than 100,000 videos. Most aren’t of children being assaulted, but too many are.”The article sparked intense scrutiny from regulators in several countries, and Visa and MasterCard suspended payment processing.It may be recalled that at the beginning of the year, Ethical Capital Partners (ECP), a Canadian private equity firm, bought MindGeek, the parent company of PornHub, bringing with it a stable of additional websites including YouPorn. The acquisition has also resulted in a slew of legal issues. In June this year, the new owner of PornHub said that the government should take pride in sexual expression instead of cracking down on porn websites. It further urged the governments to help make porn “normal and boring.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 December, 2023 ","18-year-old autistic teen given ‘life in hospital’ sentence after he hacked Nvdia, BT/EE, and then hacked GTA-VI without even a laptop in police custody",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/teenaged-hacker-sentenced-to-life-in-secure-hospital-by-uk-court-after-he-hacked-gta-vi/,"Kurtaj and the 17-year-old are the first Lapsus$ members to be convicted, although it is believed that others are still out on the loose. The gang's attacks in the years 2021 and 2022 stunned the cyber-security community. The group from the United Kingdom and Brazil was dubbed ""digital bandits"" in court.An 18-year-old hacker who was instrumental in leaking Grand Theft Auto VI footage has been sentenced to life in hospital imprisonment by a UK court. On Thursday (December 21), a British judge determined that Arion Kurtaj poses a high risk to the public because he continues to wish to commit cybercrime, BBC reported. The teenager hacked into Rockstar servers without using a computer and posted clips and source codes for the upcoming GTA-VI, while he was in police custody.Kurtaj, a key member of the international gang Lapsus$, was found guilty of cyberattacks on GTA VI developer Rockstar Games and other companies, including Uber and Nvidia, by a London jury in August. However, because Kurtaj suffers from autism and was declared unfit to stand trial, the jury was asked to decide whether he committed the crimes in question, rather than whether he did so with criminal intent.It was reported that accused Kurtaj leaked 90 videos of GTA-VI gameplay footage while on bail for hacking Nvidia and British telecom operator BT / EE last September. Despite staying in a hotel under police protection at this time and after police confiscated his laptop, Kurtaj was able to attack Rockstar Games without using a computer. He carried out the attack using the room’s Amazon Fire Stick and the TV, a newly purchased smartphone, a keyboard, and a mouse. Following the incident, Kurtaj was arrested.He stole 90 clips of the unreleased and hugely anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, and released them on social media, along with some source code. Before posting them, he threatened to release GTA source codes if Rockstar does not contact him. He broke into the company’s Slack messaging system to deliver the threat, saying, “if Rockstar does not contact me on Telegram within 24 hours I will start releasing the source code”.Kurtaj then posted the clips and source code on a GTA forum under the username TeaPotUberHacker. He posted 90 videos from a test build of Grand Theft Auto 6, running with “GTA 5 and 6 source code and assets”. The legitimacy of the videos was confirmed by Rockstar. After this, he was again arrested. After the hearing, the court sentenced him to spend his life in a hospital. The judge said Kurtaj’s skills and desire to commit cybercrime meant he remained a high risk to the public. Judge Patricia Lees said that the ‘only safe option’ was to detain him under section 37 of the Mental Health Act with a restriction order.Kurtaj will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger. He will be transferred to a secure psychiatric hospital in next month once a bed is available at Marlborough House medium-secure hospital in Milton Keynes. The court also noted that he had been violent during police custody, and there are dozens of incidents of injuries and property damages caused by him. A mental health assessment of the accused said that he continued to express the intent to return to cyber-crime as soon as possible, prompting the unique sentencing by the court. Meanwhile, another 17-year-old Lapsus$ member received an 18-month community punishment, known as a Youth Rehabilitation Order, along with a prohibition from accessing virtual private networks (VPNs). This youth, who can’t be named, suffers from ASD (autism spectrum disorder), and was sentenced to a youth rehabiliation order for 18 months earlier for hacking offences.Even after several videos leaked by Kurtaj and the trailer’s premature release on X (Twitter), the official trailer for GTA VI received hundreds of millions of views. Currently, the trailer has clocked around 155 million views on YouTube.While Kurtaj’s counsel asked the judge to consider the trailer’s success during the sentence, the BBC reports that the judge noted that Lapsus$ harmed real businesses and people. Rockstar Games told the court that it spent $5 million to recover from the hacking attack. Prosecutor Kevin Barry said that the attacks on Rockstar, Nvidia and Uber resulted in damages of £7.4m ($9.3m) for the companies.Kurtaj and the 17-year-old are the first Lapsus$ members to be convicted, although it is believed that others are still out on the loose. The gang’s attacks in the years 2021 and 2022 stunned the cyber-security community. The group from the United Kingdom and Brazil was dubbed “digital bandits” in court.The gang assumed to be primarily comprising teenagers, utilised con-man techniques as well as computer hacking to get access to multinational firms such as Microsoft, the technology behemoth, and digital banking firm Revolut. In their rampage, the hackers publicly boasted their crimes and ridiculed victims on the social network app Telegram in English and Portuguese.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"28 December, 2023 ","Delhi anti-Hindu riot: Prashant Bhushan hosted the earliest conspiracy meeting with Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Yogendra Yadav in attendance. Read details",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/delhi-anti-hindu-riot-prashant-bhushan-hosted-earliest-conspiracy-meeting-with-umar-khalid-sharjeel-imam-and-yogendra-yadav/,"Documents duly signed by Prashant Bhushan, prove that the exact address where the meeting was held on the 8th of December 2019, where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots was hatched according to the chargesheet, is indeed the office of Prashant Bhushan. The destruction and carnage unleashed during the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots 2020 left the nation in shock. On the 24th and 25th of February, Delhi was gripped with unbridled violence and riots that were unleashed after an elaborate conspiracy was hatched by certain Muslim groups and Left groups. Several conspirators have been charged and are lodged in jail, standing trial for their role in instigating and planning the violence. However, several individuals were either directly or tangentially involved in the conspiracy, who have not been named as accused in the investigation that followed the violence. The conspiracy chargesheet (59/2020) details how the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu riots took seed on the 5th of December. In the 2700-page chargesheet filed pertaining to FIR 59/2020, the Delhi Police dedicate almost 700 pages to the chronology of the conspiracy hatched. Confirming what OpIndia had already pointed out earlier, the February riots were inextricably linked to the December violence that was unleashed in various parts of the country such as Delhi, UP and other places.On the 5th of December, a WhatsApp group called Muslim Students of JNU was created by Sharjeel Imam. This was right after CAB (Citizenship Amendment Bill) was tabled in the Parliament. It was revealed in the chargesheet that Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi (a student of Jamia) were in constant touch and Sharjeel was also in touch with “radical communal group” Students of Jamia (SOJ). In 2023, Arshad Warsi was arrested by the Delhi Special Cell in connection with the Pune ISIS terror module. On the 6th of December, pamphlets which were written by Sharjeel Imam himself were distributed in the Jama Masjid area by the MSJ group. This fact was revealed by the chats recovered between Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi. The pamphlets were communal and essentially aimed to incite hate in the Muslim community by invoking the Supreme Court decision in the Ram Janmabhoomi case. Some of the pamphlets read “Law of Allah above all else” and “The command of Allah is above every law”.The pamphlets that were distributed in mosques on the 6th of December also had a call to join the protest called by ‘United Against Hate’ at Jantar Mantar in large numbers and to “mobilise mob”. On the 7th of December, Sharjeel Imam said that he would be joining the protests called by United Against Hate. This fact was revealed by his WhatsApp conversation with Arshad Warsi. While joining a protest is not wrong in itself, here is the clincher – on the 7th of December, Sharjeel Imam categorically said that he was planning something big in the next week and for that purpose, he would mobilise students from DU, AMU etc with the help of MSJ members.On the 7th of December, at the protest organised by United Against Hate, the chargesheet says that Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Nadeem Khan, Sharjeel Imam, Ifat and Sai Balaji were also present. They delivered speeches against the CAA at this protest. Umar Khalid, who was his “senior and mentor” from JNU introduced Sharjeel Imam to Yogendra Yadav at this agitation. Witnesses have told the police that earlier, Umar Khalid had already told Sharjeel Imam to make a group of “like-minded individuals” from JNU, Jamia, DU etc and had explained the concept of Chakka Jam to him. As an extension of that theme, at the meeting with Yogendra Yadav, he was told to “mobilise students of Jamia, DU and AMU”. According to the chargesheet, four important things were decided in this meeting: The entry of Yogendra Yadav in the conspiracy hatched, according to the chargesheet, dates back to the 7th of December 2019. This was only days before the Jamia violence erupted and several areas of Delhi saw violence. It was also days before Tahir Hussain admitted that he had started inciting people against CAA and pelted stones against the Hindus on the 17th.By the 7th of December, Umar Khalid and Yogendra Yadav had met Shajreel Imam. While the initial mobilisation had already started between the 5th and 7th of December, it is the events of the 8th of December that we will analyse in this report. On the 8th of December 2019, a meeting was held between Yogendra Yadav, Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid and others at a Jangpura basement. The image of this meeting has been included in the chargesheet by the Delhi Police. It was in this meeting, that according to the chargesheet, a plan was hatched on how to implement the Chakka Jam. It was decided that it would be Sharjeel Imam who would organise and lead students from various universities and colleges in and around Delhi. It was, interestingly, also decided that organisations like United Against Hate and Swarajya Abhiyaan would help each other in every way possible. This has, according to the Chargehsheet, been revealed by a witness. The fact that this meeting took place was also confirmed by the chats that were discovered between Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi. On the very same day of the meeting, a WhatsApp group was also formed (CAB TEAM) where Umar Khalid, Yogendra Yadav, Sharjeel Imam and other accused were present. According to the chargesheet, it is evident that this meeting in Jangpura was pivotal in the conspiracy that was hatched. It was in this meeting that the seeds of violence were sown and a collaborative effort between the organisations and people like Sharjeel Imam, and Umar Khalid was decided. According to the chargesheet, this pivotal meeting was held at a basement in Jangpura. The address of the meeting, as mentioned in the chargesheet, is 6/6, Jangpura Ext. When a cursory search is done, it turns out that the address, 6/6 Jangpura, is where the office of Prashant Bhushan is. Prashant Bhushan has multiple places from where he functions. His official chamber listed on the Supreme Court website (since he is an advocate on record) is New Lawyers Chamber, Supreme Court of India. 6/6 Jangpura, however, is his office which he has listed in several court documents. For example, in 2021, Prashant Bhushan was the lawyer representing a petition by Dr Jaboc Puliyel, demanding the release of vaccine data (trial and post vaccination data). Breaking: SC issues notice to the govt&vaccine companies on a petition by Dr Jacob Puliyel, former member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, seeking vaccine data (trial data & post Vaccination data)& against coercive vaccine mandateshttps://t.co/ulPCQqZPN1OpIndia found a communication by Prashant Bhushan to the Supreme Court, duly signed by him, where his office is listed at the basement of 6/6 Jangpura. This document to the Supreme Court, duly signed by Prashant Bhushan, proves that the exact address where the meeting was held on the 8th of December 2019, where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots was hatched according to the chargesheet, is indeed the office of Prashant Bhushan. The basement of 6/6 Jangpura – office of Prashant Bhushan, has birthed several anti-India campaigns apart from serving as the location where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu riots was hatched. Shanti Bhushan along with Prashant Bhushan had a few years ago set up the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Reform (CJAR) to supposedly demand accountability in the Indian judiciary. However, CJAR has been at the forefront of anti-India propaganda for long. In 2017, for example, the Supreme Court fined CJAR Rs 25,00,000 for its petition falsely accusing a judge of accepting bribes from a medical college to pass favourable orders. “No judge can be held responsible for what may or has happened in the corridors, or for ‘who purports to sell whom’. The alleged actions of a retired judge of a High Court, allegedly assuring and promising a ‘favourable’ decision… in a case which was then pending before this court, begs the question, and we wonder, as to what favourable orders have been passed,” the Bench had said in its order.CJAR was also at the forefront of running propaganda against CJI Dipak Mishra and furthering the narrative of the 4 judges who had held a press conference against the CJI at the time. Read: CJAR's press release on today's press conference by 4 seniormost judges of SC about the abuse of power of master of roster by CJI.We have also highlighted some of the politically sensitive cases where such power has been egregiously abused by the CJIhttps://t.co/TM6upzxoxeCJAR is, however, not the only organisation that functions out of 6/6 Jagpura. NAPM – National Alliance for People’s Movement is a far more vile organisation that also has its office at 6/6 Jangpura – essentially – functioning out of the office of Prashant Bhushan. NAPM was founded by Medha Patkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan fame in 1996. In 2022, Patkar was booked in a case of fraud. Medha Patkar and several others were accused of misusing funds in the name of educating tribal children. An FIR was lodged in Madhya Pradesh’s Barwani against Medha Patkar and 11 others in this regard. In the FIR, Pritam Raj, the complainant, accused Patkar of embezzling more than Rs 13 crore on the pretext of funding educational opportunities for tribal children. The complaint also alleged that Patkar had misappropriated funds since she did not have accounts for all of the donations collected for the education of the tribal poor between 2007 and 2022. According to the FIR, Medha Patkar raised more than Rs 13 crore through the ‘Narmada Navnirman Abhiyan’ foundation. She was accused of inciting anti-government sentiment by soliciting donations for education.Medha Patkar is best known for her ‘Narmada Bachao Andolan’ against the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river. The protest contributed to the years-long postponement of the Sardar Sarovar Dam project on the Narmada River. So-called social activists and environmentalists like Medha Patkar expressed concern as soon as the construction of the project started. When Medha Patkar visited the project site in 1985, she accused that the dam had fallen short of the social and environmental requirements set forth by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.For suspected money laundering during the “Narmada Bachao Andolan,” the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed an FIR against activist Medha Patkar on April 5 this year. In addition to the ED, investigations into Patkar’s shady dealings have also been initiated by the Department of Revenue Intelligence and the Income Tax Department.According to a Pioneer report, Patkar’s NGO received a donation of roughly Rs 1.2 crores within a year of its foundation in 2004 but managed to elude authorities for almost 17 years.The investigation raised several concerns regarding the payments. According to records obtained by Pioneer, the NGO received the funds on June 18, 2005, from 20 different sources in a single day. Surprisingly, the amount of all 20 donations was the same, which was Rs 5,96,294.  Pallavi Prabhaar Bhalekar, one of the donors, was a minor at the time the donations were transferred.Coming back to NAPM, it has participated in a number of propaganda campaigns whitewashing the crimes of Islamists and blaming Hindus. Its registered office is also at 6/6 Jangpura. It is pertinent to note that Medha Patkar had also participated in the anti-CAA protests which ultimately led to violence. NAPM had come out in support of GN Saibaba. GN Saibaba and several others were convicted and sentenced to life by the sessions court of Gadchiroli in March 2017 for association with the Revolutionary Democratic Front (RDF), an affiliate of CPI(Maoist). Saibaba and the others were found to be posing Naxal literature, and the court had said that they intended to circulate the literature among people in Gadchiroli to incite people to join the Naxals. Most of the material both in physical and electronic form was found with Saibaba, and he had introduced others accused in the case with the Maoist organisation.The continued incarceration of Prof. Saibaba, living with 90 % disability & chronic health issues is another disgraceful blot on the 'human rights record' of this Government! Unjustifiable that the @India_NHRC looks the other way despite being aware of the gravity of the issues. https://t.co/8VaGtEDm2MNAPM extended support to ‘The Kashmir Wala’ and others charged by NIA under UAPA. “The duo, under an active conspiracy and Pakistan’s support, resurrected a platform reviving the narrative in support of the terrorist and separatist ecosystem. They were spreading an anti-India narrative by exploiting digital platforms under a concealed and camouflaged set-up with the help of illicit funding received from hostile foreign agencies and proscribed terrorist organisations,” said an official privy to the case. Earlier in 2023, the court framed charges against Peerzada Fahad Shah. The persecution of democratic media by Modi regime is relentless! Not only has #TheKashmirWalla founder editor Fahad Shah been jailed unjustly since #18months, now the portal's digital presence has been shut off! This brutal crackdown on media in Kashmir must end. #FreeFahadShah https://t.co/7BGNRQm0aGThe organisation came out in support of NewsClick as well. NewsClick is in the dock for being funded by China and running their propaganda against the interest of India. NAPM condemns the vindictive targeting of @newsclickin in particular & independent news media in general by the current regime that does not want be accountable to the Constitution & We The People! Solidarity with progressive media, doing public service!✊🏽https://t.co/RzSVlacXKaThey blamed Hindus for the Nuh violence where Muslim mobs ran rampage attacking Hindu devotees. The hate-filled atmosphere in parts of #Haryana over the past week and violent persecution of muslims & working poor, must be seen in the light of the impunity that no less than @PMOIndia & @mlkhattar have afforded to the hindutva mobs. Shameful! #GuruGramViolence#NuhViolence https://t.co/u1UmDu62OAAs mentioned earlier, Medha Patkar, who founded NAPM, was also a part of the anti-CAA protests. Interstingly, NAPM’s registered office is the same as the registered office of Prashant Bhushan where the 8th December meeting between Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid, Yogendra Yadav and others were held, conspiring to unleash violence. Throughout the violence which started in December 2019 and lasted till the 26th of February 2020, NAPM was at the forefront of offering help and support to the accused. On the 15th of December 2019, NAPM extended support to the Jihadis of Jamia who committed unbridled violence during their anti-CAA protest. It is pertinent to note that the chargesheet also details how students of Jamia had attacked police with weapons, petrol bombs, rods and stick. These violent Jihadis had injured 10 policemen on duty. The police had found that this was a premeditated incident of violence. Movements from across the country stand with the students of Jamia Millia Islamia. We condemn the shameful and cowardly assault by the Delhi Police on the University and its students. Please join them in solidarity!#SOSJAMIANAPM too played to role of instigating mobilisation on the 15th of December 2019. Call to comrades to join all night protest against police brutality outside Delhi Police Headquarters at ITO in Delhi. pic.twitter.com/DBmrqfZ9u6They have rallied for the release of the Jihadis arrested pursuant to the chargesheet 59/2020 – those who were a part of the conspiracy.

Was Prashant Bhushan present at the said meeting between Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid and others? 3. Was it in Bhushan’s knowledge that a plan for chakka jam and ensuing violence was being hatched at this meeting? 4. Whose proposal was it to hold the said meeting at Bhushan’s office space? 5. To what extend was Prashant Bhushan involved in the meeting? 6. Was he privy to the conversation being held during the meeting? 7. Ishrat Jahan and Khalid Saifi have named Prashant Bhushan in their disclosure statements during the Delhi Riots investigation. The statements mention that he had extensively participated in the anti-CAA protests which ultimately led to violence. Prashant Bhushan needs to be investigated for the extent of his involvement in these protests. 8. Was he a part of the DPSG Whatsapp group or any of the groups that were created to coordinate the protests and the ensuing violence? 9. Has the Delhi Police approached him to question him about the meeting held at his office basement, where the police say the conspiracy for the violence was hatched on the 8th of December 2019? The Delhi anti-Hindu riot was an elaborate conspiracy to teach Hindus a lesson. That this violence was specifically designed to target Hindus and the ruling government of India has been established by the Delhi Police in their chargesheets which painfully documents how the conspiracy to spark violence progressed daily ever since the 5th of December 2019. With one of the earliest meetings furthering the conspiracy being held at Prashant Bhushan’s office, it becomes imperative that Bhushan is questioned about his involvement in the violence and the conspiracy to spark violence.

"28 December, 2023 ",OpIndia Exclusive: Who introduced Robert Vadra to CC Thampi? ED’s chargesheet against Sanjay Bhandari mentions Sonia Gandhi link. Read here,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-introduced-robert-vadra-to-cc-thampi-eds-pmla-chargesheet-against-sanjay-bhandari-mentions-sonia-gandhi-link/,"In ED's supplementary chargesheet, it was established that Thampi was a close associate of Vadra. The connection was revealed through financial transactions, including the renovation of a London property and land deals in Faridabad.In its supplementary chargesheet at the PMLA court, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has finally established a direct connection between the Gandhi son-in-law Robert Vadra, CC Thampi and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. In a 84-page chargesheet, the ED has detailed how Robert Vadra was linked to Bhandari through a London property and how Vadra came in contact with CC Thampi, a crucial link in the case. The chargesheet reveals that it was Sonia Gandhi’s PA, Madhavan, who introduced Vadra to Thampi. Cheruvathur Chakkutty Thampi, a Delhi-based real estate dealer, is the accused no 7 in ED’s PMLA case against Sanjay Bhandari and his associates. The ED, on the chargesheet submitted on 22nd December to the Special Court, mentions that CC Thampi, who worked for the absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, is a close aide of Robert Vadra – the husband of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The ED established the link in the supplementary chargesheet filed against CC Thampi and Sumit Chadha (said to be a close relative of Sanjay Bhandari) in a money laundering case. This is the first time that ED has named Vadra in their chargesheet.Establishing the role of Sonia Gandhi’s PA in the matter, the charge sheet’s page 43 read, “During the course of investigation in the case, statements of Sh. CCT (CC Thambi) were recorded under Section 50 of PMLA on various dates. In his statement recorded on 19.06.2019, Sh. CCT stated that he knew Sh. Robert Vadra for more than ten years, and he (Sh. Robert Vadra) was initially introduced to him (Sh. CCT) by Mr. Madhavan, P.A. to Smt. Sonia Gandhi.”PP Madhavan has been Sonia Gandhi’s PA for a long time. In June 2022, he was accused of rape by a Dalit woman. However, Madhavan had stated that the charges against him were baseless. The Enforcement Directorate has named Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi and husband of Priyanka Gandhi, in a money laundering case linked to CC Thampi and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. In ED’s supplementary chargesheet, it was established that Thampi was a close associate of Vadra. The connection was revealed through financial transactions, including the renovation of a London property and land deals in Faridabad.Furthermore, links between Rahul Gandhi and CC Thampi were revealed, and it was suggested that HL Pahwa, reportedly funded by Thampi, was involved in the case. Priyanka Gandhi purchased land from Pahwa at a reduced price. The land was later sold back at an inflated price. The funds for these transactions were reportedly provided by Thampi. Our detailed report on the matter can be checked here. OpIndia had broken the HL Pahwa story and Priyanka Vadra connection back in 2019.

"25 December, 2023 ","Everything you need to know about The Telecom Bill 2023, and how it aims to modernise and secure the telecommunication sector in India",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-telecom-bill-2023/,"The telecom industry was managed in India by the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933. These two laws needed to be updated, and were not fully aligned with the current technological realities.On 21st December, the Telecom Bill 2023 was passed in Rajya Sabha, a day after it was passed in Lok Sabha. The bill introduced several critical changes aimed at benefitting the general public by modernising and securing the telecommunication sector in the country.The telecom industry was managed in India by the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933. These two laws needed to be updated, and were not fully aligned with the current technological realities. The Telecom Bill 2023 replaced both of them and introduced several clauses that will streamline the telecommunication industry as per the latest technological scenario in the country.One of the most prominent aspects of the bill is the streamlined authorisation and spectrum allocation. The bill mandates prior permission from the union government for telecommunication-related activities. The main aim is to streamline the process of managing telecommunication services. Spectrum allocation is primarily done via auction, except the allocation is done for specific purposes such as disaster management and national security.The approach will provide for a more flexible and scalable regulatory framework. It will help in forming a mechanism for quicker responses to technological advancements. The central government will be authorised to re-purpose or reassign any required frequency range. The government of India now holds the power to permit the sharing, trade, lease, and surrender spectrum.The bill emphasises on a strong verification process for telecom service provided. Now, it will be mandatory to get biometric-based identification for the subscribers before issuing SIM cards. The government has brought this change to enhance security and accountability within the telecom sector.Notably, the new bill has introduced strict penalties for fraudulent SIM procurement, mandatory consent for advertising messages, biometric-based subscriber verification, specific conditions for spectrum allocation, and stringent penalties for unauthorised telecom services or equipment. Furthermore, companies can procure telecom equipment only from trusted sources per the government’s guidelines.The government has now the power to intercept the messages and a class of messages between two or more persons if the government deems it necessary to do so for reasons including national security, prevention of incitement of offences or public order. On similar grounds, the government will have the right to suspend the telecom services. Furthermore, the government may take temporary possession of any telecom infrastructure or service for any public emergency. However, unlawful interception will attract penalties. In the earlier draft of the Telecom Bill, Over-The-Top services were categorised under telecommunication services. However, in the revised bill, the government opted for a more inclusive approach and encapsulated OTT within a broader definition of telecommunication. In short, if the government wishes to classify OTT services as “telecommunication services”, it can do it. The aim is to combat digital fraud and misuse of communication platforms.While services like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram are out of their purview, it has to be noted that OTT content is going to be monitored. The OTT entities will come under the purview of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, and the content distributed on these platforms will be overseen by the Information and Broadcasting Ministry. In the case of the satellite spectrum allocation, the bill specifically benefits the satellite broadband services sector. The bill has moved away from auction-based allocation to an administrative assignment model. It will allow the operators to bring enhancements efficiently in the sector.If the company surrenders the spectrum license, it could claim the fee paid at the time of the allocation. However, as per the new bill, there is no option to receive a refund of the fee if the entities surrender their license, registration, authorisation or assignment. It is aimed to bring financial discipline and commitment across the telecom sector and operators.The bill has removed the provisions of restructuring, the default of payment and insolvency. The aim is to bring a more market-driven approach to the sector where the telecom operators will be held responsible for their financial sustainability and risk management. It has been seen in the past that telecom operators leave the market all of a sudden due to financial mismanagement. By removing the provisions that may support such withdrawal of service from the market, the government aimed to bring more accountability on the operators’ part.The government renamed the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) “Digital Bharat Nidhi”. The bill introduced a broader operational scope to allow its use for new and existing telecommunication services and technologies. The idea is to move towards a more inclusive approach to telecommunication development in India.The bill has brought a clear distinction between broadcast services and telecommunications. Now, the broadcasting services have been referred to as per the Cable Television Networks Act for regulatory guidance. It will bring clearer regulatory boundaries and help streamline the frameworks across the sectors.Media houses are criticising the bill as it puts journalists under the scanner. According to mainstream media, as the new bill requires to furnish correct information, it could “impede whistle-blowers as well as journalists who operate under anonymity”. Interestingly, in recent times, several of the mainstream media stories turned out to be fake. Be it the Meta fiasco of The Wire or the Pegasus story that turned upside down when investigated. Who can forget how The Wire forged a complete investigation to blame the BJP for running an underground app, “Tek Fog“?Furthermore, PRS Legislative Research claimed that the provision of surveillance would lower the degree of privacy of communications for all users. However, such arguments fail to comprehend the depth of telecommunication usage by the anti-India elements and terrorist organisations. Any such activity can be put to rest at the foundation stage if the interception of such messages is done properly as per the guidelines.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 December, 2023 ","No missile tests, no fishing, ‘Arribada’ is happening: Read how Odisha prepares to welcome lakhs of Olive Ridley turtles coming from faraway oceans",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/no-missile-tests-no-fishing-arribada-odisha-prepares-to-welcome-lakhs-of-olive-ridley-turtles/,"The migration of sea turtles is a biological phenomenon that has intrigued scientists for decades. We are yet to fully understand how sea turtles manage to find their way through thousands of miles across oceans of the world and come to the same beach generation after generation. Turtles contribute significantly to ocean ecosystems by maintaining healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs, which provide critical habitats for other marine life. They also play a significant role in the balance of marine food webs and the transfer of nutrients from water to land. Unfortunately, many of the turtle species have become critically endangered and are losing lives as a result of human activities. For instance, around 800 Olive Ridley sea turtles died on a beach in Odisha after getting stuck in fishing nets in 2021. Many dead turtles bore injuries, which pointed to the possibility of them being trapped in a trawl or gill net. In Kasaragod, Kerala on 5th June this year, 56 turtles were found burnt to death following a fire at a wetland in Madavayal near Pilicode. In Mumbai, in January this year, dozens of turtles died due to deliberate poisoning last year. As per the locals, the turtles were illegally staying in the lake and were eating the fish so they were poisoned. Humans at times, fail to realize that the extinction of turtles is causing harm to the marine biodiversity and that conservation of turtles is crucial to help conserve biodiversity and to maintain natural balance.The migration of sea turtles is a biological phenomenon that has intrigued scientists for decades. We are yet to fully understand how sea turtles manage to find their way through thousands of miles across oceans of the world and come to the same beach generation after generation. Odisha’s coastal areas, especially the mouth of some rivers in the state are crucial nesting grounds for Olive Ridley turtles. Every year, lakhs of Olive Ridley turtles come to lay their eggs on the beaches. The turtle mothers go back. When the eggs hatch, the hatchlings start another epic voyage across the sea to their habitats across the oceans, only to come back as adults to the very same beach where they had hatched. To welcome, and provide a safe nesting to these ocean guests, the Odisha govt and the center go to extraordinary lengths. The Odisha government and the Central Government have together imposed a prohibitory ban on sea fishing activity within 20 km of the coast in Kendrapara, Odisha where the Olive Ridley turtles come ashore to nest and lay eggs.According to the reports, the ban has been imposed from the 1st of November and will remain in force until 31st May 2024. As per the forest department official, the areas notified include the sea around the mouths of the rivers Dhamara, Devi, and Rusikulya to guarantee the safety of marine animals such as Olive Ridley turtles during the nesting and breeding season.Every year, the prohibition is tightened as more turtles are killed by becoming entangled in fishing nets or being hit by the propellers of fishing trawlers. The annual measure will remain in effect in the Olive Ridley turtle habitation corridors by the provisions of the Orissa Marine Fishing Regulation Act (OMFRA), 1982, and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, government officials have informed.The female Olive Ridley turtles essentially invade the nesting beaches typically at the dead of the night for laying eggs – a phenomenon which is called ‘Arribada’, which means ‘arrival by the sea’ in Spanish. . Turtles leave the nesting area after laying their eggs to return to the deep sea. After 45-60 days, hatchlings emerge from the eggs. It is a rare natural occurrence in which baby turtles grow without their mothers before being released into the sea.As of now, the Olive Ridley turtles have started arriving on the coastal waters. Officials have spotted them mating in the coastal waters. The ‘Arribada’ will start in a few weeks. Our guests have arrived. Mass mating of Olive Ridley have started off the coast of Odisha at Rushikulya & Gahiramatha rookery. Arribada, meaning “arrival by sea”, for mass nesting is few weeks away only. pic.twitter.com/Eqmf1SqASTOlive Ridley turtles turn up in lakhs for mass nesting along the Odisha coast every year. They lay eggs in en-mass at the Gahirmatha beach in Kendrapara strict, the Rushikulya river mouth in Ganjam, and the Devi river mouth in Puri.In addition to Coast Guard personnel, a multi-layered state-sponsored patrolling exercise involving forest, fisheries, and marine police would also be implemented during the prohibition period. In Bhadrak, Rajnagar, Puri, and Berhampur, the state’s four wildlife divisions, 61 on-shore camps, and five offshore camps have been established to guarantee efficient patrolling. The patrolling teams for the forests and fisheries will be flanked by the armed police constabulary.Thirteen trawlers, support boats, and five high-speed boats have further been called into action to stop illicit marine fishing in restricted areas.Notably, the fishing prohibition will have an impact on over 10,600 fishing families. So, the state government has decided to give each of the impacted fishermen’s families a one-time livelihood assistance of Rs 15,500 to make up for the loss of their income. The Gahirmatha coast, which is hailed as the largest habitation corridor of Olive Ridley turtles, has a complete year-round ban on sea fishing. Given the population of turtles, it has been granted the designation of marine sanctuary.Sea turtles have traveled great distances throughout the world’s oceans for over 100 million years, playing a crucial role in maintaining the equilibrium of marine habitats. From the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific to the vibrant reefs of the Coral Triangle and the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, seven distinct species of sea (or marine) turtles inhabit our ocean waters. Although sea turtles are highly migratory animals, they spend the majority of their lives in the ocean. At times, they come ashore to nest or bask.The seven species, most of which stand endangered today are Leatherback, Loggerhead, Green turtle, Flatback, Hawksbill, Kemp’s Ridley, and Olive Ridley. Among these Leatherback, Loggerhead, and Olive Ridley have become vulnerable whereas Green Turtle, Hawksbill, and Kemp’s Ridley have become critically endangered. As per the research report by World Wild Life, hundreds and thousands of members of these species are lost each year to incidental capture during fishing, overharvesting, and illegal trade. Human activity has shifted the odds against the survival of these ancient mariners during the past 200 years. Sea turtles are killed for their meat, eggs, skin, and shells. they are also overfished and subject to poaching. In addition, they have to deal with habitat degradation and unintentional bycatch in fishing gear. Turtle nesting sites are impacted by climate change since it changes the temperature of the sand, which in turn affects the sex of the hatchlings. Three of the seven species of sea turtles that are currently recognized are critically endangered which is a fact to worry about. Considering the given status, the Central government has also stepped up to conserve the species and not disturb them during their nesting period. Earlier this month, India’s top military research and development organization, the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), decided to suspend missile testing at Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha from January to March 2024 to give the endangered Olive Ridley sea turtle species a strong chance of surviving. The said decision was made by a committee headed by Odisha chief secretary P K Jena. The Integrated Test Range at the Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Chandipur in Odisha is where many of India’s missiles and weapons systems are tested. All testings have now been suspended for 3 months so that Olive Ridley turtles are not disturbed. As per a Times of India report, the Coast Guard and Army will also patrol the coast to prevent fishing boats and trawlers from approaching the small stretches of sand that are near bays and estuaries, where turtles lay their eggs. The chief secretary stated that the committee emphasized the necessity of sending out advisories to businesses, establishments, and industrial buildings along the coast to adhere to outdoor lighting laws. The director of the Integrated Testing Range (ITR) at Chandipur in Balasore has further been urged by the wildlife division to make space available for the establishment of temporary forest camps outside Abdul Kalam Island’s perimeter.“The DRDO will also nominate a nodal officer for better coordination with the forest department for the safety of the Olive Ridleys,” an official was quoted as saying. Marine turtles are an essential component of marine ecosystems. Seagrass beds and coral reefs that support commercially valuable species like prawns, lobster and tuna are kept healthy with their assistance. Sea turtles are the living embodiment of a class of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years. Turtles are highly valued both as tourist attractions and cultural icons. Five of the seven species can be found worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical waters. The ranges of the remaining two species, however, are quite small: the Flatback turtle is primarily found in northern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea, while the Kemp’s Ridley is primarily found in the Gulf of Mexico.With this broad global turtle picture, it is important for India to conserve the vulnerable turtle species that are also on the verge of becoming extinct now. Olive Ridley’s vulnerable status comes from the fact that they nest in a very small number of places, and therefore any disturbance to even one nest beach could have huge repercussions on the entire population. It’s just a question of a few months until they settle completely. The fishermen and the locals who unknowingly or deliberately cause harm to the species must understand the core and work towards peaceful co-existence. It is then that India will have a robust ocean ecosystem maintained by healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs, which ultimately will provide critical habitats for other marine life.A sight that casts magical spell year after year👍 Nearly 2 crore plus olive Ridley hatchlings have emerged & made their way to sea from half of about 4 lakh nesting at Nasi-2 islands, Gahirmatha rookery Odisha.The spectacle continues. Early morning video. pic.twitter.com/C0IKTWNCkoWith sustainable and inclusive efforts from the state and central government, and with the help of local people, the coasts of Odisha are eagerly waiting for the annual guests to arrive in large numbers and have a safe nesting season. The government officials and volunteers will then put all their efforts into ensuring safe hatching for the millions of eggs on the beaches. When the little hatchlings leave the beach to swim thousands of miles back to their home waters, the same beaches will wish them a safe voyage, and safe growing years, and hope they come back as adults again.

"28 December, 2023 ","Tesla to set up its first Indian factory in Gujarat, announcement likely during Vibrant Gujarat event in January 2024",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/tesla-is-coming-to-gujarat-mou-may-get-signed-during-vibrant-gujarat-summit/,"Gujarat Health Minister and government spokesperson Rushikesh Patel said that the government is actively in talks with the electric car maker to finalise the deal on establishing the manufacturing plant in Gujarat.  Tesla is finally coming to India. According to reports, Elon Musk’s electric car manufacturing company may announce its debut in India in January 2024 during the Vibrant Gujarat Summit scheduled to be held in Gandhinagar. The upcoming summit is the 10th edition of the annual global gathering of investors who want to take advantage of Gujarat’s pro-business policies.Reports suggest that Elon Musk, founder and CEO of Tesla, is expected to participate in the summit. Local reports indicate the company is in the final stage of negotiations with the government for the manufacturing unit land.Gujarat Health Minister and government spokesperson Rushikesh Patel said that the government is actively in talks with the electric car maker to finalise the deal on establishing the manufacturing plant in Gujarat.  As per Gujarat Samachar, Tesla may establish a manufacturing unit in Sanand. Tata Motors already has a manufacturing unit in Sanand. Tata Motors has also acquired the Ford’s plant in Sanand after the American car maker exited India. Maruti Suzuki, MG Motor, JCB, Honda two-wheelers and Hero MotoCorp also have manufacturing units in Gujarat.A memorandum of understanding between the Gujarat government and Tesla may be signed during the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit. Earlier, Tesla also hinted that it is interested in establishing a battery manufacturing unit in India apart from a car manufacturing unit.Several other states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, have their eyes on Tesla’s investments in the country. Gujarat’s favouring environment for Tesla is not only because of the land access but also access to ports to export the cars to other countries. Apart from Sanand, Becharaji and Dholera are also under consideration, according to the media reports.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the United States, he met Elon Musk. At that time, Tesla hinted that the company was reconsidering its investment plans in India. So far, the high import duties in India have remained a deal breaker for the company. Tesla wanted to enter the Indian market by introducing cars made in the Shanghai Gigafactory in China, but the Indian govt wanted the company should start its Indian business with locally made cars. This led to a halt on the company’s plan to enter the Indian market. However, it seems the company has now changed its position of not investing in India. Furthermore, Union Minister Piyush Goyal also visited Tesla facilities during his recent visit to the US. Following his meeting with PM Modi, Musk spoke about his leadership role in making technology inclusive so that digital infrastructure can be created, he said, “I can say he really wants to do the right thing for India. He wants to be open, he wants to be supportive of new companies, obviously, but at the same time, make sure it accrues to India’s advantage, which is obviously that’s the job I’m saying. I am a fan of Modi,” to ANI. In response to PM Modi’s tweet regarding his meeting with business leaders in the US, Musk tweeted, “It was an honour to meet again.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He said that Pakistan has an opportunity to become one for a bright future, but the system, cost of debt and sources of income in Pakistan are not sustainable, and spending on people and infrastructure development is limited, Pakistan newspapwer Dawn reported.Pakistan is heavily exposed to climate change, with the potentially devastating impacts of climate shocks and natural disasters already apparent, he said in Development Advocate Pakistan, the UNDP’s quarterly development magazine providing a platform for Pakistan’s authorities, civil society and intelligentsia to exchange ideas on key development solution pathways in the country.Benhassine emphasised that policy failures in the agri-food sector should be addressed. In agriculture, reforms are required to unwind the subsidies and price restrictions that lock smallholder farmers into a low-value farming system and encourage resource-intensive and environmentally damaging production practices.The World Bank Country director said action was needed to change policies holding back development.Reforms in energy sector should consolidate progress towards financial sustainability, improve the efficiency of distribution companies, including through increased private participation, and address the very high costs of electricity generation through increased renewable generation, the World Bank official said.“The question is whether those with power and influence will take the opportunity arising from the current crisis to do what is needed.

"28 December, 2023 ",Maharashtra: ‘What will they do with the seats?’ asks Congress as it rejects Uddhav Sena’s demand for 23 seats for Lok Sabha elections,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/maharashtra-congress-rejects-uddhav-senas-demand-for-23-seats-for-lok-sabha-elections/,"Former Chief Minister and senior Maharashtra Congress leader Ashok Chavan stated that the parties needed to adjust. ""While every party desires a larger share of seats, the demand for 23 seats by the Shiv Sena was excessive given the current circumstances,"" he said.The Congress Party has rejected the Shiv Sena’s (UBT) demand for 23 seats in Maharashtra in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The development came after Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi partners Shiv Sena (UBT), Congress, and NCP met to talk about seat sharing for the Lok Sabha elections.Despite the majority of its members supporting CM Eknath Shinde’s faction, the UBT Sena reportedly demanded 23 of the 48 seats in Maharashtra. According to Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam, Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena faction faces an enormous obstacle because it lacks sufficient candidates due to the party’s division.Following the splits in the Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar’s NCP, Congress representatives at the meeting stated unequivocally that the grand old party seems to be the only one with an established vote share in the state.Former Chief Minister and senior Maharashtra Congress leader Ashok Chavan stated that the parties needed to adjust. “While every party desires a larger share of seats, the demand for 23 seats by the Shiv Sena was excessive given the current circumstances,” he said.According to Sanjay Nirupam, leaders ought to prevent conflicts over winning seats. “The Shiv Sena may demand 23 seats, but what will they do with them? The Shiv Sena’s leaders have left, resulting in a crisis. Shiv Sena faces a candidate shortage,” he said. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut stated last week that he and party leaders Uddhav Thackeray and Aaditya Thackeray met with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, senior leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, as well as AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, before the recent Opposition bloc I.N.D.I Alliance meeting.Raut did not specify how many seats the Congress and NCP would contest.

"28 December, 2023 ",Punjab’s AAP minister Laljit Singh Bhullar calls for merging Haryana and Himachal Pradesh with Punjab to form ‘Maha-Punjab’,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/aap-minister-in-punjab-calls-for-merging-haryana-and-himachal-pradesh-into-punjab/,"Laljit Singh Bhullar said that Haryana and Himachal Pradesh were created by spiting Punjab, and now the bigger state should be reinstated by merging themOn 27th December, just a day before the scheduled meeting on the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal between Punjab and Haryana, the Aam Aadmi Party’s Cabinet Minister from Punjab, Laljit Singh Bhullar, called for merging Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to form a “Maha-Punjab“. He said that Haryana and Himachal Pradesh were created by spiting Punjab, and now the bigger state should be reinstated by merging them.He added that Chandigarh should also be included. Bhullar also accused the then-central government of splitting Punjab to create Haryana. The Central Government should consider incorporating Haryana and Himachal Pradesh into Punjab. Responding to the Syl issue, AAP Punjab Cabinet Minister Laljit Singh Bhullar suggested that if Haryana becomes part of Punjab, many issues would be easily resolved. He also added that… pic.twitter.com/u6MF1E8EntIn a statement, while speaking to the media, Bhullar said, “Haryana and Punjab are brothers. Haryana is the younger brother, and Punjab is the elder brother. BJP is trying to create differences between the two brothers. The separation (of states) should be demolished. The Centre should consider merging Himachal Pradesh and Haryana in Punjab so that we can become one. Chandigarh should also be included. It was Maha-Punjab earlier. There was a time when there was only one chief minister of Punjab. The Centre should reconsider merging the three states. People of Haryana will be happy too.”Bhullar was in Bhiwani in Haryana when he gave the statement. The media asked Bhullar about his views on the SYL matter. Instead of providing a straightforward answer, Bhullar called for merging Haryana, Punjab and HP into one state.The canal, once completed, will enable sharing of the water from rivers Beas and Ravi between the two states. Before Haryana was formed, undivided Punjab was given 7.20 MAF (Million-acre feet) out of the total 15.85 MAF water flowing down Ravi and Beas. Among other stakeholders, Rajasthan was allotted 8 MAF while Jammu and Kashmir got 0.65 MAF.After the creation of Haryana, the centre issued a notification allocating 3.5 MAF to Haryana out of the 7.2 MAF allotted to Punjab before the reorganisation. In a reassessment in 1981, the water flowing down Beas and Ravi was estimated at 17.17 MAF, out of which 4.22 MAF was allocated to Punjab, 3.5 MAF to Haryana, and 8.6 MAF to Rajasthan.In 1982, PM Indira Gandhi launched the construction of the SYL canal at Kapoori village in Patiala. However, Akalis started a protest movement against it by the name of Kapoori Morcha. In 1985, then-PM Rajiv Gandhi signed an agreement with Akali Dal chief Sant Harchand Singh Longowal for a new tribunal to assess the water. Shortly afterwards, Longowal was killed by the terrorists in Punjab.In 1990, the chief engineer working on the project, ML Sekhri and a Superintending Engineer, Avtar Singh Aulakh, were killed by Balwinder Jattana (mentioned in Sidhu Moosewala’s song), and following that, the construction of the canal came to a halt.After the independence, East Punjab was the province that included current Punjab and Haryana, and northern parts of Himachal Pradesh. In September 1066, Punjab Reorganisation Act was passed by the parliament, forming the state of Haryana. The Act also transferred some regions to Himachal Pradesh. This separation was the result of the Punjabi Suba movement, which agitated for the creation of an autonomous Punjabi-speaking state. Therefore, a majority Hindi-speaking state Haryana was created. The Punjabi Suba movement gave birth to the violent Khalistani movement. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

According to reports, since October 2021 an incredible 96 lakh physical files have been discarded from central government offices freeing up over 355 lakh square feet of space overall. This has resulted in office hallways being cleaned and vacated space ending up for recreation centers as well as other beneficial applications.Around Rs 600 crore was spent on India’s successful Chandrayaan-3 moon mission and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration could have comfortably financed two of such missions by selling junk such as files, condemned office equipment and defunct vehicles.

I haven't been invited and wouldn't have visited even if I were invited. Faith is quite a private matter I think,” Sharad Pawar said. On Wednesday (27th December), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar revealed that he was not invited to the inauguration ceremony or Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. He also attacked the BJP, claiming it was unclear whether the party was using the issue for political or commercial purposes. “Don’t know if it (BJP) is using the issue for political or commercial purposes. We are happy that the temple is coming up for which many have contributed,” Pawar said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are among the over 6,000 people envisioned to be present at the Ram Lalla idol’s ‘Pran Pratistha’, or consecration ceremony, next month. Pawar meanwhile also asserted that he wouldn’t go even if he were invited to the inauguration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. “I visit only two to three places of faith that I don’t speak about in public. We are all happy that the Ram Mandir is finally being built and so many people have contributed to see this day. I haven’t been invited and wouldn’t have visited even if I were invited. Faith is quite a private matter I think,” he said. Notably, in the year 2022, the BJP alleged that Pawar was an atheist and possessed hatred for Hindu Gods and Goddesses. However, later Pawar clarified that he believed in Godly faith but never loved to exhibit it out in the open. Earlier, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee stated that she would not attend the inauguration ceremony. “There is no question of Mamata Banerjee or any other representative of the TMC attending the Ram Mandir inauguration at Ayodhya next month. We don’t believe in mixing politics with religion,” a senior party leader was quoted as saying.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) called the ceremony a private event by BJP and said that would visit the Ram Mandir after the BJP’s event is over. “This is all politics, who wants to attend an event by the BJP?

"28 December, 2023 ","Ram Janmabhoomi: Online booking of passes for Aarti of Ram Lalla begins, limited passes now for security reasons",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ram-janmabhoomi-online-booking-of-passes-for-aarti-of-ram-lalla-begins/,"The online facility for generating the 'aarti' passes started a few days ago. Devotees can generate their passes online, collect them from the counter at Ayodhya and proceed for the 'aarti'The booking for obtaining ‘aarti’ passes kicked off on Thursday at the Ram Janmobhoomi temple ahead of the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla on January 22.Aartis are performed three times a day (6:30 am, 12 pm, 7:30 pm) for Lord Ram Lalla for which passes are generated for the devotees, the section manager for ‘Aarti pass’, Dhruvesh Mishra, said.“At Ram Janmabhoomi, aarti is held three times a day for Lord Ram Lalla — at 6.30 in the morning, at noon and in the evening at 7.30. In the morning, Sringar aarti takes place, which is followed by Bhog aarti in the afternoon and Sandhya aarti in the evening. Only pass-holders can attend the three aartis,” Mishra told ANI on Thursday.On the number of people who can attend an ‘aarti’ at one time, Mishra said, “Right now, only 30 people are allowed to attend each aarti with a pass. This number could be increased as per the number of devotees in future.”On the reasons for the limited number of devotees for the ‘aarti’ ritual, Mishra said, “We have a limited number of passes for now for the sake of protection of the temple premises and security reasons.”On whether the passes could be generated free of cost, the section manager said, “The service is the same for all the devotees, whether elderly or young, poor or rich.”Mishra said the online facility for generating the ‘aarti’ passes started a few days ago. Devotees can generate their passes online, collect them from the counter at Ayodhya and proceed for the ‘aarti’, he said.“The online facility started a few days back. One can apply for the aarti pass on the official portal of the Ram Janmaboomi temple. A time limit has been allotted for the same. Devotees can generate their passes online, receive it there and then head straight for the ‘aarti’,” Mishra said.On the documents needed for getting the ‘aarti’ passes, the manager said, “Only four documents are admissible for generating the aarti pass. These are Aadhar card, voter ID, driving licence and passport. Of these, the devotees are required to carry just one. They can show it to the official after receiving their aarti passes.”The grand consecration ceremony of Lord Ram Lalla is scheduled for January 22 next year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address attendees at the grand event from the front of the ‘Singh Dwar’, the main entrance to the temple, sources said earlier on Thursday.According to sources, lakhs of devotees are likely to pour into the temple town for the January 22 consecration. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"28 December, 2023 ","ED now confirms OpIndia’s 2019 newsbreak, names Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in charge sheet highlighting dubious land deals and Sanjay Bhandari links",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ed-confirms-opindias-2019-newsbreak-names-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-in-charge-sheet-for-dubious-land-deals-and-sanjay-bhandari-links/,"This is the first time that ED has named Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in their chargesheet. ED's chargesheet confirms OpIndia's 2019 newsbreak regarding the Gandhi connection to the dubious land deals.On Thursday (December 27), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) named Robert Vadra for the first time in its supplementary chargesheet in the money laundering case against arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. The ED established a direct connection between the Gandhi son-in-law Robert Vadra, CC Thampi and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. In the chargesheet, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s name has also featured. Priyanka has been named in connection with a dubious land purchase and sale to an individual named HL Pahwa. That story was first broken y OpIndia in 2019. The ED on the 22nd of December told the Special Court that CC Thampi, who worked for the absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, is a close aide of Robert Vadra – the husband of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The link has been established by the ED in the supplementary chargesheet filed against CC Thampi and Sumit Chadha (said to be a close relative of Sanjay Bhandari) in a money laundering case.This is the first time that ED has named Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in their chargesheet. ED’s chargesheet confirms OpIndia’s 2019 newsbreak regarding the Gandhi connection to the dubious land deals. “Further, Smt. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wife of Sh. Robert Vadra also purchased agricultural land measuring 40 kanal (05 acres) in village Amipur, District Faridabad, Haryana from Sh. H.L. Pahwa in April, 2006…,” ED chargsheet reads.Back in 2019, OpIndia had unearthed papers that linked Rahul Gandhi himself to Sanjay Bhandari through a string of dubious land deals involving HL Pahwa and CC Thampi – who the ED has now acknowledged is a close aide of Robert Vadra.These papers are related to the ED search conducted on one HL Pahwa on 3rd May 2017 and 4th May 2017. The land dealings are between Rahul Gandhi and H L Pahwa who was funded by CC Thampi – CC Thampi was known to be a close aide of Robert Vadra. As per the ED chargesheet filed in the PMLA court on 22nd December, CC Thampi has stated to ED that he was introduced to Robert Vadra by Sonia Gandhi’s PA Madhavan. OpIndia revealed in 2019 that not only Rahul Gandhi but also Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had purchased land from HL Pahwa. According to a sale deed dated 3 March 2008, Gurgaon resident HL Pahwa sold nine acres of land in Hasanpur village in Haryana’s Palwal district to Robert Vadra for Rs 36.9 lakh. In addition, a sale record from Rajasthan’s Bikaner district shows that Sarita Devi Bothra, 42, sold 4.63 acres of land in Basti village in Ganganagar tehsil for Rs 8.5 lakh to Real Earth Estate Private Limited, a New Delhi-based company, in April 2009. Notably, Robert Vadra is the company’s director.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also bought land from HL Pahwa. OpIndia earlier reported that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra purchased land and then sold it for an inflated price to the same person four years later. The person in question was also HL Pahwa. On April 28, 2006, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra purchased land from HL Pahwa for Rs. 15,00,000 in two cheques, and subsequently sold it back to HL Pahwa for Rs. 84,15,006 via multiple cheques on February 17, 2010.As reported earlier, here the link between HL Pahwa and CC Thampi emerges. When Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sold the land back to HL Pahwa at an exorbitant price, Pahwa repaid Gandhi in five instalments between May 22nd and September 11th, 2009. The stated reason for the instalment payment was ‘non-availability of funds’.CC Thampi was arrested in 2020 and is currently out on bail. In February 2019, Robert Vadra was grilled for over 5 hours for his alleged links to CC Thampi. The Enforcement Directorate suspects kickbacks for a petroleum deal in 2009 were routed through the Sharjah-based company, allegedly controlled by a UAE-based NRI businessman, CC Thampi. Vadra was also questioned about owning Benami property in London along with CC Thampi and Sanjay Bhandari. Thampi has a company in UAE called Sky Light and in India, Skylight Hospitality Private Limited is allegedly linked to Vadra and is under the ED scanner for suspect land deals in Bikaner, Rajasthan. ED had served him a show-cause notice last year for violation of laws in the acquisition of agricultural and other lands in and around Delhi-NCR in deals amounting to over Rs 288 crore.The ED chargesheet mentions that between 2005 and 2008 Thampi purchased around 486 acres of land from Pahwa in the same Amipur village in Faridabad. The chargesheet mentions that Pahwa was receiving cash ‘out of the books’ when Priyanka sold the land to him. Also, Robert Vadra reportedly did not pay the entire sale consideration to Pahwa. CC Thampi is accused number 7 in the ED’s PMLA case against Sanjay Bhandari and associates. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"28 December, 2023 ","Delhi anti-Hindu riot: Prashant Bhushan hosted the earliest conspiracy meeting with Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Yogendra Yadav in attendance. Read details",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/delhi-anti-hindu-riot-prashant-bhushan-hosted-earliest-conspiracy-meeting-with-umar-khalid-sharjeel-imam-and-yogendra-yadav/,"Documents duly signed by Prashant Bhushan, prove that the exact address where the meeting was held on the 8th of December 2019, where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots was hatched according to the chargesheet, is indeed the office of Prashant Bhushan. The destruction and carnage unleashed during the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots 2020 left the nation in shock. On the 24th and 25th of February, Delhi was gripped with unbridled violence and riots that were unleashed after an elaborate conspiracy was hatched by certain Muslim groups and Left groups. Several conspirators have been charged and are lodged in jail, standing trial for their role in instigating and planning the violence. However, several individuals were either directly or tangentially involved in the conspiracy, who have not been named as accused in the investigation that followed the violence. The conspiracy chargesheet (59/2020) details how the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu riots took seed on the 5th of December. In the 2700-page chargesheet filed pertaining to FIR 59/2020, the Delhi Police dedicate almost 700 pages to the chronology of the conspiracy hatched. Confirming what OpIndia had already pointed out earlier, the February riots were inextricably linked to the December violence that was unleashed in various parts of the country such as Delhi, UP and other places.On the 5th of December, a WhatsApp group called Muslim Students of JNU was created by Sharjeel Imam. This was right after CAB (Citizenship Amendment Bill) was tabled in the Parliament. It was revealed in the chargesheet that Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi (a student of Jamia) were in constant touch and Sharjeel was also in touch with “radical communal group” Students of Jamia (SOJ). In 2023, Arshad Warsi was arrested by the Delhi Special Cell in connection with the Pune ISIS terror module. On the 6th of December, pamphlets which were written by Sharjeel Imam himself were distributed in the Jama Masjid area by the MSJ group. This fact was revealed by the chats recovered between Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi. The pamphlets were communal and essentially aimed to incite hate in the Muslim community by invoking the Supreme Court decision in the Ram Janmabhoomi case. Some of the pamphlets read “Law of Allah above all else” and “The command of Allah is above every law”.The pamphlets that were distributed in mosques on the 6th of December also had a call to join the protest called by ‘United Against Hate’ at Jantar Mantar in large numbers and to “mobilise mob”. On the 7th of December, Sharjeel Imam said that he would be joining the protests called by United Against Hate. This fact was revealed by his WhatsApp conversation with Arshad Warsi. While joining a protest is not wrong in itself, here is the clincher – on the 7th of December, Sharjeel Imam categorically said that he was planning something big in the next week and for that purpose, he would mobilise students from DU, AMU etc with the help of MSJ members.On the 7th of December, at the protest organised by United Against Hate, the chargesheet says that Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Nadeem Khan, Sharjeel Imam, Ifat and Sai Balaji were also present. They delivered speeches against the CAA at this protest. Umar Khalid, who was his “senior and mentor” from JNU introduced Sharjeel Imam to Yogendra Yadav at this agitation. Witnesses have told the police that earlier, Umar Khalid had already told Sharjeel Imam to make a group of “like-minded individuals” from JNU, Jamia, DU etc and had explained the concept of Chakka Jam to him. As an extension of that theme, at the meeting with Yogendra Yadav, he was told to “mobilise students of Jamia, DU and AMU”. According to the chargesheet, four important things were decided in this meeting: The entry of Yogendra Yadav in the conspiracy hatched, according to the chargesheet, dates back to the 7th of December 2019. This was only days before the Jamia violence erupted and several areas of Delhi saw violence. It was also days before Tahir Hussain admitted that he had started inciting people against CAA and pelted stones against the Hindus on the 17th.By the 7th of December, Umar Khalid and Yogendra Yadav had met Shajreel Imam. While the initial mobilisation had already started between the 5th and 7th of December, it is the events of the 8th of December that we will analyse in this report. On the 8th of December 2019, a meeting was held between Yogendra Yadav, Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid and others at a Jangpura basement. The image of this meeting has been included in the chargesheet by the Delhi Police. It was in this meeting, that according to the chargesheet, a plan was hatched on how to implement the Chakka Jam. It was decided that it would be Sharjeel Imam who would organise and lead students from various universities and colleges in and around Delhi. It was, interestingly, also decided that organisations like United Against Hate and Swarajya Abhiyaan would help each other in every way possible. This has, according to the Chargehsheet, been revealed by a witness. The fact that this meeting took place was also confirmed by the chats that were discovered between Sharjeel Imam and Arshad Warsi. On the very same day of the meeting, a WhatsApp group was also formed (CAB TEAM) where Umar Khalid, Yogendra Yadav, Sharjeel Imam and other accused were present. According to the chargesheet, it is evident that this meeting in Jangpura was pivotal in the conspiracy that was hatched. It was in this meeting that the seeds of violence were sown and a collaborative effort between the organisations and people like Sharjeel Imam, and Umar Khalid was decided. According to the chargesheet, this pivotal meeting was held at a basement in Jangpura. The address of the meeting, as mentioned in the chargesheet, is 6/6, Jangpura Ext. When a cursory search is done, it turns out that the address, 6/6 Jangpura, is where the office of Prashant Bhushan is. Prashant Bhushan has multiple places from where he functions. His official chamber listed on the Supreme Court website (since he is an advocate on record) is New Lawyers Chamber, Supreme Court of India. 6/6 Jangpura, however, is his office which he has listed in several court documents. For example, in 2021, Prashant Bhushan was the lawyer representing a petition by Dr Jaboc Puliyel, demanding the release of vaccine data (trial and post vaccination data). Breaking: SC issues notice to the govt&vaccine companies on a petition by Dr Jacob Puliyel, former member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, seeking vaccine data (trial data & post Vaccination data)& against coercive vaccine mandateshttps://t.co/ulPCQqZPN1OpIndia found a communication by Prashant Bhushan to the Supreme Court, duly signed by him, where his office is listed at the basement of 6/6 Jangpura. This document to the Supreme Court, duly signed by Prashant Bhushan, proves that the exact address where the meeting was held on the 8th of December 2019, where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu Riots was hatched according to the chargesheet, is indeed the office of Prashant Bhushan. The basement of 6/6 Jangpura – office of Prashant Bhushan, has birthed several anti-India campaigns apart from serving as the location where the conspiracy for the Delhi anti-Hindu riots was hatched. Shanti Bhushan along with Prashant Bhushan had a few years ago set up the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Reform (CJAR) to supposedly demand accountability in the Indian judiciary. However, CJAR has been at the forefront of anti-India propaganda for long. In 2017, for example, the Supreme Court fined CJAR Rs 25,00,000 for its petition falsely accusing a judge of accepting bribes from a medical college to pass favourable orders. “No judge can be held responsible for what may or has happened in the corridors, or for ‘who purports to sell whom’. The alleged actions of a retired judge of a High Court, allegedly assuring and promising a ‘favourable’ decision… in a case which was then pending before this court, begs the question, and we wonder, as to what favourable orders have been passed,” the Bench had said in its order.CJAR was also at the forefront of running propaganda against CJI Dipak Mishra and furthering the narrative of the 4 judges who had held a press conference against the CJI at the time. Read: CJAR's press release on today's press conference by 4 seniormost judges of SC about the abuse of power of master of roster by CJI.We have also highlighted some of the politically sensitive cases where such power has been egregiously abused by the CJIhttps://t.co/TM6upzxoxeCJAR is, however, not the only organisation that functions out of 6/6 Jagpura. NAPM – National Alliance for People’s Movement is a far more vile organisation that also has its office at 6/6 Jangpura – essentially – functioning out of the office of Prashant Bhushan. NAPM was founded by Medha Patkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan fame in 1996. In 2022, Patkar was booked in a case of fraud. Medha Patkar and several others were accused of misusing funds in the name of educating tribal children. An FIR was lodged in Madhya Pradesh’s Barwani against Medha Patkar and 11 others in this regard. In the FIR, Pritam Raj, the complainant, accused Patkar of embezzling more than Rs 13 crore on the pretext of funding educational opportunities for tribal children. The complaint also alleged that Patkar had misappropriated funds since she did not have accounts for all of the donations collected for the education of the tribal poor between 2007 and 2022. According to the FIR, Medha Patkar raised more than Rs 13 crore through the ‘Narmada Navnirman Abhiyan’ foundation. She was accused of inciting anti-government sentiment by soliciting donations for education.Medha Patkar is best known for her ‘Narmada Bachao Andolan’ against the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada river. The protest contributed to the years-long postponement of the Sardar Sarovar Dam project on the Narmada River. So-called social activists and environmentalists like Medha Patkar expressed concern as soon as the construction of the project started. When Medha Patkar visited the project site in 1985, she accused that the dam had fallen short of the social and environmental requirements set forth by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.For suspected money laundering during the “Narmada Bachao Andolan,” the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed an FIR against activist Medha Patkar on April 5 this year. In addition to the ED, investigations into Patkar’s shady dealings have also been initiated by the Department of Revenue Intelligence and the Income Tax Department.According to a Pioneer report, Patkar’s NGO received a donation of roughly Rs 1.2 crores within a year of its foundation in 2004 but managed to elude authorities for almost 17 years.The investigation raised several concerns regarding the payments. According to records obtained by Pioneer, the NGO received the funds on June 18, 2005, from 20 different sources in a single day. Surprisingly, the amount of all 20 donations was the same, which was Rs 5,96,294.  Pallavi Prabhaar Bhalekar, one of the donors, was a minor at the time the donations were transferred.Coming back to NAPM, it has participated in a number of propaganda campaigns whitewashing the crimes of Islamists and blaming Hindus. Its registered office is also at 6/6 Jangpura. It is pertinent to note that Medha Patkar had also participated in the anti-CAA protests which ultimately led to violence. NAPM had come out in support of GN Saibaba. GN Saibaba and several others were convicted and sentenced to life by the sessions court of Gadchiroli in March 2017 for association with the Revolutionary Democratic Front (RDF), an affiliate of CPI(Maoist). Saibaba and the others were found to be posing Naxal literature, and the court had said that they intended to circulate the literature among people in Gadchiroli to incite people to join the Naxals. Most of the material both in physical and electronic form was found with Saibaba, and he had introduced others accused in the case with the Maoist organisation.The continued incarceration of Prof. Saibaba, living with 90 % disability & chronic health issues is another disgraceful blot on the 'human rights record' of this Government! Unjustifiable that the @India_NHRC looks the other way despite being aware of the gravity of the issues. https://t.co/8VaGtEDm2MNAPM extended support to ‘The Kashmir Wala’ and others charged by NIA under UAPA. “The duo, under an active conspiracy and Pakistan’s support, resurrected a platform reviving the narrative in support of the terrorist and separatist ecosystem. They were spreading an anti-India narrative by exploiting digital platforms under a concealed and camouflaged set-up with the help of illicit funding received from hostile foreign agencies and proscribed terrorist organisations,” said an official privy to the case. Earlier in 2023, the court framed charges against Peerzada Fahad Shah. The persecution of democratic media by Modi regime is relentless! Not only has #TheKashmirWalla founder editor Fahad Shah been jailed unjustly since #18months, now the portal's digital presence has been shut off! This brutal crackdown on media in Kashmir must end. #FreeFahadShah https://t.co/7BGNRQm0aGThe organisation came out in support of NewsClick as well. NewsClick is in the dock for being funded by China and running their propaganda against the interest of India. NAPM condemns the vindictive targeting of @newsclickin in particular & independent news media in general by the current regime that does not want be accountable to the Constitution & We The People! Solidarity with progressive media, doing public service!✊🏽https://t.co/RzSVlacXKaThey blamed Hindus for the Nuh violence where Muslim mobs ran rampage attacking Hindu devotees. The hate-filled atmosphere in parts of #Haryana over the past week and violent persecution of muslims & working poor, must be seen in the light of the impunity that no less than @PMOIndia & @mlkhattar have afforded to the hindutva mobs. Shameful! #GuruGramViolence#NuhViolence https://t.co/u1UmDu62OAAs mentioned earlier, Medha Patkar, who founded NAPM, was also a part of the anti-CAA protests. Interstingly, NAPM’s registered office is the same as the registered office of Prashant Bhushan where the 8th December meeting between Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid, Yogendra Yadav and others were held, conspiring to unleash violence. Throughout the violence which started in December 2019 and lasted till the 26th of February 2020, NAPM was at the forefront of offering help and support to the accused. On the 15th of December 2019, NAPM extended support to the Jihadis of Jamia who committed unbridled violence during their anti-CAA protest. It is pertinent to note that the chargesheet also details how students of Jamia had attacked police with weapons, petrol bombs, rods and stick. These violent Jihadis had injured 10 policemen on duty. The police had found that this was a premeditated incident of violence. Movements from across the country stand with the students of Jamia Millia Islamia. We condemn the shameful and cowardly assault by the Delhi Police on the University and its students. Please join them in solidarity!#SOSJAMIANAPM too played to role of instigating mobilisation on the 15th of December 2019. Call to comrades to join all night protest against police brutality outside Delhi Police Headquarters at ITO in Delhi. pic.twitter.com/DBmrqfZ9u6They have rallied for the release of the Jihadis arrested pursuant to the chargesheet 59/2020 – those who were a part of the conspiracy. NAPM is deeply concerned about the scores of young people incarcerated by Delhi Police on questionable grounds since months! Many of them are muslims, students, women – all vulnerable in #COVID19 times! We condemn 150 days of unjust jailing & demand #ReleaseKhalidAndIshrat pic.twitter.com/H5HHme43sd19 Delhi-based scholars and activists who were a part of the nation-wide anti-CAA protests, have been wrongly booked under UAPA, Arms Act and others, and jailed since the start of 2020. Total number of such arrests in Delhi has exceeded 1300. #IfWeDoNotRise@RahulBose1FREE #UmarKhalid an activist of #UnitedAgainstHate, student leader working for democratic rights & against communal violence, being wrongfully accused in the Delhi Pogrom. Drop the arbitrary charges #ScrapUAPA #ReleaseAllPoliticalPrisoners #FreeTheYoung pic.twitter.com/49cA2s0G8lIt is pertinent to note that NAPM is spreading propaganda, demanding for the release of Umar Khalid – the very Umar Khalid who was one of the masterminds of the Delhi anti-Hindu riots and was present for the 8th December meeting held at 6/6 Jangpura – the office of Prashant Bhushan and the registered office of NAPM. 2. In the 59/2020 chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police, the address of a meeting held between Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others on the 8th of December 2019 has been mentioned as 6/6 Jangpura basement. Was Prashant Bhushan present at the said meeting between Sharjeel Imam, Umar Khalid and others? 3. Was it in Bhushan’s knowledge that a plan for chakka jam and ensuing violence was being hatched at this meeting? 4. Whose proposal was it to hold the said meeting at Bhushan’s office space? 5. To what extend was Prashant Bhushan involved in the meeting? 6. Was he privy to the conversation being held during the meeting? 7. Ishrat Jahan and Khalid Saifi have named Prashant Bhushan in their disclosure statements during the Delhi Riots investigation. The statements mention that he had extensively participated in the anti-CAA protests which ultimately led to violence. Prashant Bhushan needs to be investigated for the extent of his involvement in these protests. 8. Was he a part of the DPSG Whatsapp group or any of the groups that were created to coordinate the protests and the ensuing violence? 9. Has the Delhi Police approached him to question him about the meeting held at his office basement, where the police say the conspiracy for the violence was hatched on the 8th of December 2019? The Delhi anti-Hindu riot was an elaborate conspiracy to teach Hindus a lesson. That this violence was specifically designed to target Hindus and the ruling government of India has been established by the Delhi Police in their chargesheets which painfully documents how the conspiracy to spark violence progressed daily ever since the 5th of December 2019. With one of the earliest meetings furthering the conspiracy being held at Prashant Bhushan’s office, it becomes imperative that Bhushan is questioned about his involvement in the violence and the conspiracy to spark violence. Note: OpIndia has sent an email to Prashant Bhushan asking for his response to this story. No response has been received so far.

"28 December, 2023 ","EVM-VVPAT hacking claims, old wine in a new bottle – Here is how Prashant Bhushan is beating a dead horse",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/here-is-how-prashant-bhushan-is-beating-a-dead-horse-on-evms/,"A similar fearmongering about VVPATs was created by former IAS officer Kannan Gopinath in 2019 in a thread on X (formerly Twitter). On Wednesday, 27th December, the infamous lawyer-cum-activist and a professional andolanjivi, Prashant Bhushan, shared an 11:11-minute-long video on X (formerly Twitter) claiming EVMs and VVPATs can be hacked. In a post in Hindi, Bhushan said, “See for yourself how EVMs and VVPAT machines can be tampered with. This can be done when the program is entered during symbol loading. That is why many countries, including Bangladesh, also went back to paper ballots. Earlier, BJP people also demanded a paper ballot. Now, why did it change after coming to power? Why was the glass of the VVPAT machine blackened?”खुद देख लीजिए, किस तरह से, ई वी एम, और वीवीपेट मशीनों में छेड़छाड़ हो सकती है। सिंबल लोडिंग के समय जो प्रोग्राम डाला जाता है, उस समय, इस तरह से किया जा सकता है।इसीलिए ज्यादा देश और बांग्लादेश भी वापस पेपर वॉलेट की तरफ चले गये।पहले भाजपा के लोग भी पेपर बैलट की मांग करते थे। अब… pic.twitter.com/s73wTu13kqPrashant Bhushan shared the video of engineer Rahul Chimanbhai Mehta, founder and chief of the Gujarat-based Right to Recall Party. In the video, Mehta expressed concerns about Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) being hackable. He claimed that VVPATs could be manipulated to show a particular candidate’s name but register a different candidate. To prove his theory, he used a “DO IT YOURSELF” VVPAT system that he made himself. Of course, he made it himself; after all, he is an engineer who returned from the US.Anyway, using the dummy VVPAT, he showed how it could be manipulated using the ‘Banana-Apple’ theory that he has been talking about for years. Mehta claimed he was using the mock VVPAT because the Election Commission of India refused to give him a VVPAT machine to check. In the video, he claimed that the manufacturer of the VVPAT machine changed the glass from transparent to black in 2017 to facilitate the manipulation of votes. He further claimed that the black glass used on VVPAT can be used to manipulate what voters see and what happens in the background. All he “proved” using a mock VVPAT machine that he made, possibly in his garage, that it had nothing close to what actual VVPAT looks and works like.The charlatan then moved a step forward and claimed that as there are transparent screens that can project content, even if the manufacturer rolls back to fine screens, they would not be 100 per cent unhackable. Mehta claimed that the software to manipulate voting could be done at the time of symbol loading, making tracking impossible. He then called for rolling back to ballot papers.As the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 approach, the opposition parties have started crying foul over EVMs. Almost every other party and leader wants to go back to the ballot paper. Either they have forgotten or think the voters have forgotten the mess ballot papers created during voting.Booth capturing, fake voting and riots were common in India earlier. Who can forget what recently happened during the Panchayat Elections in West Bengal, where ballot papers were used. Despite all the problems that ballot papers have created in the past, the political parties want to roll back to it. Interestingly, some may think capturing booths would be easier than winning voters’ hearts.Interestingly, Prashant Bhushan is not the only one who shared Mehta’s bizarre video to raise his voice against EVMs and VVPATs. A courtesy search on social media showed that several X users shared the video in the past 24 hours. Congress leader Vikas Bansal shared the video and claimed EVM and VVPAT machines can be hacked.Founder of The Pillania, journalist Amandeep Pillania, shared the video crediting Prashant Bhushan.Shree Raghuveer shared the video and tagged several Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Digvijay Singh.Now, the question is if Mehta is claiming this for the first time or if he is a habitual fearmonger. Well, let’s go with the latter and have a look at his history. Mehta is an IIT Delhi graduate and a self-proclaimed anti-corruption activist. He worked as a software engineer in the US for some time and came back to India in 1999. In 2018, he formed a political party named the ‘Right To Recall Party’ and contested the Lok Sabha Elections in 2019 on 14 seats.All the candidates who fought the election under the RTRP banner lost their deposits. The 14 candidates covered eight states: Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, and Delhi. The party received a total of 28,817 votes, out of which 13,140 votes were secured by Pawan Kumar Sharma, who contested the election from Bhilwara, Rajasthan. The remaining votes were scattered across other candidates, with Mehta securing only 1097 votes. He contested from Gandhinagar.In 2013, VVPATs were first introduced for the single constituency in Nagaland. Later, in 2017, ECI announced that it would use VVPATs for all elections. Since then, Mehta has been claiming that VVPATs can be hacked. A video on the matter was published on his YouTube channel in 2017, where he called VVPATs ‘timewaste’. In the video, he claimed the CIA was pressuring the Election Commission of India to continue using EVM machines and emphasised the return of ballot papers.The real drama came in April 2019 when he published a video of the famous “Banana-Apple” theory. However, as it was only hypothetical, he did not get much attention.By August, he had created his first mock VVPAT Machine to explain his “Banana-apple” theory. His first mock VVPAT had roughly cut cardboard pieces. Please note that we are not mocking the effort at all. This is just for the information.In October 2019, Mehta even gave a newspaper ad describing his ‘Banana-Apple’ theory. The Editor of Scroll, Naresh Fernandes, shared it on social media.Ad in today’s Express issued by Mr Rahul Mehta about bananas and apples and VVPATs. pic.twitter.com/MZ8siAioUzBy April 2023, he was ready with a better mock replica of VVPAT that looked much better than the cardboard. This is the same machine in the video Prashant Bhushan and others shared.A similar fearmongering about VVPATs was created by former IAS officer Kannan Gopinath in 2019 in a thread on X (formerly Twitter). So, you might remember my spirited defense of EVMs. I still stand by it, except that my first election with VVPAT has taken away my trust. VVPAT has created a hole in the EVM armor & made the process amenable to hacking @DrSYQuraishi @AshokLavasa @ECISVEEP https://t.co/uKdu7AfBeeThese activists are not the only ones who are demanding to remove EVMs or creating an atmosphere of fear of rigging around them. On 19th December, I.N.D.I Alliance parties tabled a resolution on EVMs demanding the slips should not fall in the box automatically but should be handed over to the voters so that they can put them in the ballot boxes. Further, they demanded 100% counting of VVPAT slips. “This will restore full confidence of the people in free and fair elections”, the resolution read. It is interesting to see Congress did not cry foul in Telangana, where they won the Assembly elections.Sharing the Resolution of the INDIA parties on EVMsये है EVM पर इंडिया की पार्टियों द्वारा पारित किया गया प्रस्ताव। pic.twitter.com/R6E944ksbYOn 26th December, Congress’s Sam Pitroda also claimed elections can be rigged using EVMs and VVPATs.#WATCH | On the EVM issue raised by opposition leaders & possibility of voting machines being rigged, Chairman Indian Overseas Congress, Sam Pitroda says, ""The answer is yes, mainly because of VVPAT (Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) is introduced, attached, working and it… pic.twitter.com/2dxSSNBBVKDespite all the claims, it has to be noted that EVMs and VVPATs are safe and cannot be manipulated. Interestingly, no one came forward when ECI organised a hackathon and challenged everyone to hack EVM machines.Notably, VVPATs and EVMs are stand-alone machines. They are not connected to the internet. It significantly nullifies the chances of remote hacking. Furthermore, VVPATs provide a paper trail for each vote. The voters can verify it at the time of the elections and again after the election. All ballots are time-stamped, and all voting booths are under CCTV surveillance, making it impossible to manipulate the votes.Regarding the technicalities, EVMs and VVPATs run on Application Specific Integrated Circuits or ASICs. These are different from general-purpose computers and resistant to hacking via malware. These ICs are not reprogrammable, which means the code they run cannot be altered. Furthermore, there is no possibility of a Trojan Horse attack either. No subsequent key presses will be recorded once a ballot key is pressed until a new ballot is enabled. It prevents any malicious signal injection. The latest models of EVM machines have temper detections that render the EVM machines inoperative if there is a temper attempt.In short, all the ‘hallabol‘ around EVMs and VVPATs is nothing more than fearmongering and should be seen as pre-poll acceptance of defeat.

"28 December, 2023 ","‘Make Mayawati PM candidate if you want BSP in I.N.D.I. Alliance’, says BSP MP Malook Nagar",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bsp-will-join-i-n-d-i-alliance-if-mayawati-is-made-pm-candidate-mp-malook-nagar/,"BSP MP Malook Nagar said, ""To effectively challenge the BJP, the I.N.D.I. alliance must nominate Mayawati as their candidate for Prime Minister. If that does not happen, no coalition stands a chance against Modi.""On Wednesday (27th December), BSP MP from Bijnor Malook Nagar said that the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will consider joining the I.N.D.I. alliance if it makes BSP-supremo Mayawati the Prime Ministerial candidate in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections of 2024. This statement by Mayawati’s close aide Malook Nagar has come after UP Congress president Ajay Rai suggested the BSP should seriously consider joining the I.N.D.I. alliance.BSP MP Malook Nagar added that the Congress must apologise for weaning away BSP MLAs in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan after the 2018 assembly elections. He claimed that Mayawati is the tallest Dalit leader in the country and support for her cuts across states. He said, “By projecting Mayawati as the PM candidate, the INDIA alliance will be able to stop the BJP from winning a third consecutive term in the upcoming Lok Sabha election. To effectively challenge the BJP, the I.N.D.I. alliance must nominate Mayawati as their candidate for Prime Minister. If that does not happen, no coalition stands a chance against Modi.”Malook Nagar further said, “The victory formula for the alliance is clear. In the 2022 (Uttar Pradesh) assembly election, the BJP polled 41.3% votes. The parties constituting the INDIA bloc polled around 40% votes and the BSP secured around 13% votes. If the BSP joins the alliance, the vote percentage will go above 50% which is enough to snatch power from the BJP.”The BSP leader added, ” The projection of Mayawati as the PM candidate will also bring back the Dalit voters who have been lured by the saffron brigade. The I.N.D.I. alliance should decide to project the BSP chief as the PM candidate. Mayawati will (then) not only forgive the Congress for its misdeed to poach the BSP MLAs in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh but will also have a positive approach towards the I.N.D.I. alliance offer.”Malook Nagar said, “No matter how much anyone discusses Ram temple, it will benefit the BJP. Ram belongs to all of us, not just the BJP, but the politics and questions raised about the temple will benefit the BJP in the coming days.”Notably, Congress is willing to take BSP along in the I.N.D.I. alliance. However, other parties in the alliance are not welcoming BSP. Especially, the Samajwadi Party of Akhilesh Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Dal of Jayant Choudhari are not willing to join hands with the BSP.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"28 December, 2023 ",OpIndia Exclusive: Who introduced Robert Vadra to CC Thampi? ED’s chargesheet against Sanjay Bhandari mentions Sonia Gandhi link. Read here,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/who-introduced-robert-vadra-to-cc-thampi-eds-pmla-chargesheet-against-sanjay-bhandari-mentions-sonia-gandhi-link/,"In ED's supplementary chargesheet, it was established that Thampi was a close associate of Vadra. The connection was revealed through financial transactions, including the renovation of a London property and land deals in Faridabad.In its supplementary chargesheet at the PMLA court, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has finally established a direct connection between the Gandhi son-in-law Robert Vadra, CC Thampi and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. In a 84-page chargesheet, the ED has detailed how Robert Vadra was linked to Bhandari through a London property and how Vadra came in contact with CC Thampi, a crucial link in the case. The chargesheet reveals that it was Sonia Gandhi’s PA, Madhavan, who introduced Vadra to Thampi. Cheruvathur Chakkutty Thampi, a Delhi-based real estate dealer, is the accused no 7 in ED’s PMLA case against Sanjay Bhandari and his associates. The ED, on the chargesheet submitted on 22nd December to the Special Court, mentions that CC Thampi, who worked for the absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, is a close aide of Robert Vadra – the husband of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The ED established the link in the supplementary chargesheet filed against CC Thampi and Sumit Chadha (said to be a close relative of Sanjay Bhandari) in a money laundering case. This is the first time that ED has named Vadra in their chargesheet.Establishing the role of Sonia Gandhi’s PA in the matter, the charge sheet’s page 43 read, “During the course of investigation in the case, statements of Sh. CCT (CC Thambi) were recorded under Section 50 of PMLA on various dates. In his statement recorded on 19.06.2019, Sh. CCT stated that he knew Sh. Robert Vadra for more than ten years, and he (Sh. Robert Vadra) was initially introduced to him (Sh. CCT) by Mr. Madhavan, P.A. to Smt. Sonia Gandhi.”PP Madhavan has been Sonia Gandhi’s PA for a long time. In June 2022, he was accused of rape by a Dalit woman. However, Madhavan had stated that the charges against him were baseless. The Enforcement Directorate has named Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi and husband of Priyanka Gandhi, in a money laundering case linked to CC Thampi and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. In ED’s supplementary chargesheet, it was established that Thampi was a close associate of Vadra. The connection was revealed through financial transactions, including the renovation of a London property and land deals in Faridabad.Furthermore, links between Rahul Gandhi and CC Thampi were revealed, and it was suggested that HL Pahwa, reportedly funded by Thampi, was involved in the case. Priyanka Gandhi purchased land from Pahwa at a reduced price. The land was later sold back at an inflated price. The funds for these transactions were reportedly provided by Thampi. Our detailed report on the matter can be checked here. OpIndia had broken the HL Pahwa story and Priyanka Vadra connection back in 2019.

The mob broke a police cordon and forcibly put 137 refugees on two trucks, and moved them to another location in Banda Aceh.

"28 December, 2023 ","Rs 5.5 lakhs from Taj Palace Hotel, 1.6 crores from Rishabh Pant: How a conman ‘ex-cricketer’ duped money by posing as IPS officer",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/5-5-lakhs-from-taj-palace-hotel-1-6-crores-from-rishabh-pant-conman-posing-as-ips-officer/,"Upon checking the accused Mrinank Singh's phone, police found that he had known several young female models and had multiple videos and pictures of them, including some that the police described as ""highly objectionable."" The police said that by pretending to be an IPL player, Singh used to befriend models and young girls.The Delhi Police arrested a 25-year-old former cricketer Mrinank Singh on Monday (December 25) for allegedly defrauding multiple luxury hotels, including the Taj Palace, of lakhs of rupees. The accused, defrauded the Taj Palace in Delhi of Rs 5.5 lakh in July 2022. He also cheated cricketer Rishabh Pant of Rs 1.6 crore between the years 2020-2021.Mrinank Singh claimed to have played for the Haryana Under-19 team and the Mumbai Indians in the India Premier League (IPL). Singh, according to police, used to cheat luxury hotels by posing as Karnataka’s Additional Director General of Police, Alok Kumar. According to Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sandeep Garg, Mrinank along with his accomplice was arrested from a club in Panchkula. The identity of the aide has not yet been revealed.In the recent case, Vijay Singh, a Jalandhar-based travel agent, alleged that the accused, posing as an assistant director general of police, had domestic air tickets and hotel rooms booked for 5.78 lakh. Later, he visited him in Mohali, where he borrowed 50,000 rupees and promised to return it in 15 minutes. Accused Mrinank, however, escaped without returning the money.According to a complaint filed by the Taj Palace at the Chanakyapuri Police Station in Delhi in July 2022, Mrinank Singh stayed at the hotel for a week in July last year and left without paying his bill of Rs 5,53,362. When asked to pay the bill, Mrinank Singh said that Adidas, who he claimed was his sponsor, would do so.The hotel staff proceeded to give Mrinank Singh the hotel’s bank details, and he gave them a transaction ID indicating that a payment of Rs 2 lakh had been processed. However, the hotel’s system did not record the transaction.Mrinank and his manager, Gagan Singh, were called, and the conman informed the hotel personnel that he would send his driver to pay the outstanding amount. However, he did not make the payment, following this, a complaint was lodged against him. Police issued a notice to Mrinank’s address during the investigation, but he could not be traced there either. Singh’s father informed the police that he and his family had disowned and expelled Mrinank Singh from their properties since they had no control over him. The authorities were unable to track Mrinank’s whereabouts since he frequently changed it, and his phone was switched off.The police subsequently issued a non-bailable warrant against Mrinank Singh and a lookout circular was also issued to arrest him in case he tries to flee the country. Mrinank Singh was stopped by Immigration police at Delhi’s IGI Airport on December 25 while attempting to board a flight to Hong Kong.Mrinank Singh attempted to dupe the immigration authorities during his detention at the IGI Airport. He called senior police officials, posing as Alok Kumar, ADGP Karnataka, and asked for assistance in helping his son Mrinank Singh, who had been “illegally detained” at the IGI Airport. The accused, however, was turned over to the Delhi Police by immigration officers.Mrinank Singh continually tried to deceive authorities during interrogation, claiming that his “father,” Ashok Kumar Singh, was also an international cricket player who played for the Indian cricket team from the 1980s to the late 1990s. Mrinank Singh reportedly told police that his “father” was a manager for Air India and was posted at IGI Airport.During the questioning, conman Mrinank Singh admitted to defrauding several luxury resorts and hotels of lakhs of rupees while posing as the Karnataka ADGP. He would also claim to be a player of the Mumbai Indians from 2014 to 2018 and use it to leave hotels without paying the bills. Mrinank Singh’s targets, according to the police, included hotels, bars, restaurants, young girls, cab drivers, small eating outlets, etc.Mrinank approached Pant and his manager, Puneet Solanki, in January 2021, claiming to be in the business of buying and selling luxury watches, bags, and jewelry. He claimed to have sold the products to several other cricketers as well.Pant believed his lies and gave the accused a luxury watch and a few other jewelry items to resell. In return, the accused gave him a 1,63,00,000 cheque in February 2021, which eventually bounced when Pant tried to cash it in.Upon checking the accused Mrinank Singh’s phone, police found that he had known several young female models and had multiple videos and pictures of them, including some that the police described as “highly objectionable.” The police said that by pretending to be an IPL player, Singh used to befriend models and young girls.Mrinank Singh, according to police, had an obsession with living a luxury lifestyle that included staying in five-star hotels, partying with models and taking photos with them, and flying abroad with his girlfriends. Furthermore, the contents of his phone proved that he used to buy and consume drugs regularly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"27 December, 2023 ","As goons attack shops over ‘smaller Kannada fonts’ on signboards in Bengaluru, here is how Karnataka Congress leaders have been fanning the language divide...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/here-is-how-congress-leaders-has-been-fanning-the-language-row-that-led-to-pro-kannada-violence/,"In May this year, just before the Assemby elections, Congress and other opposition leaders spread mass hysteria that ‘outside’ companies (non-Karnataka-based) will trample the local businesses, which could lead to ‘cultural, political, lingual, and economic subjugation’. Tensions have been escalating in Karnataka particularly Bengaluru after several outfits carried out violent protests over the language row. Members of pro-Kannada activist group Karnataka Rakshana Vedike stormed the streets in Bengaluru on 27th December (Wednesday). As per reports, the protestors pelted stones and vandalised and defaced the properties of several business establishments after accusing them of not using or boldly highlighting the mandated percentage of Kannada language in their signboards.  Conspicuously, the goons displaying violent linguistic chauvinism gained strength from the fact that the administration and ruling party leaders had made statements fanning the language divide. Two days ago, the BBMP order made it mandatory to display signage covering 60% of space with content in the Kannada language while the rest 40% could be in English. And Karnataka Rakshana Vedike is demanding immediate implementation of this rule. They even attacked establishments having separate English and Kannada signboards, demanding that all signboards must have Kannada occupying at least 60% space.The today’s vandalism comes after repeated comments of ruling Congress leaders, both before and after the elections, calling for wider use of Kannada in the state.Earlier on 17th October, Karnataka CM and Congress stalwart Siddaramaiah asserted that everyone living in Karnataka should learn to speak Kannada. He said, “We are all Kannadigas, people speaking different languages have settled in Kannada land since the unification of Karnataka. Everyone living in Karnataka should learn to speak Kannada.”He argued that in some parts, other language speakers didn’t learn or speak anything in Kannada for which he blamed the negligence and generosity of Kannadigas that allowed it.    He demanded that Kannadigas should ask non-Kannada speakers to learn their language instead of themselves learning other languages. He added, “Instead of Kannadigas teaching our language to others, we are learning their language first. In some parts of the state, the diaspora does not speak Kannada at all. This is happening because of the generosity of the Kannadigas.”The Chief Minister noted that although Kannada had been the official language for many years, negligence might have been the main reason behind the non-implementation of Kannada in the administration. He stressed that while one should respect other languages, one should not forget their own language. In May this year, just before the Assemby elections, Congress and other opposition leaders spread mass hysteria that ‘outside’ companies (non-Karnataka-based) will trample the local businesses, which could lead to ‘cultural, political, lingual, and economic subjugation’. The Congress party and its ecosystem which was also assisted by JDS back then, used the Amul-Nandini controversy to whip up regionalism and linguistic chauvinism by framing non-Kanadigas as outsiders, potential usurpers and cultural imperalists. Former Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah even appealed to the Kannadigas to boycott the Amul brand as it was not based in the state.While speaking about the matter, he had said, “In addition to language treason by the imposition of Hindi and land treason by trespassing within the state borders, now the BJP government is going to betray the farmers by shutting down Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), which is the livelihood of millions of dairy farming families in the country.”Congress leader DK Shivakumar suggested a larger conspiracy in the entry of Amul into the Karnataka market. The controversy fueled sub-regionalism and stroked langague and culture war. An escalated langauge war also erupted after the prominent opposition leaders from Congress went after labels on FMCG products particularly Dahi.  Additionally, on the counting day for assembly elections, Congress CM candidate Siddaramaiah had reprimanded journalists for using Hindi. Responding to media queries, he dragged the language divide, refused to answer questions in Hindi, and asked reporters to either use English or Kannada.In April 2022, in a controversial response to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s opinion that Hindi could be looked at as an alternative to English, the Congress leader had asserted that Hindi is not India’s national language and he will never let it happen. He alleged that it was an agenda of unleashing “cultural terrorism” against non-Hindi-speaking states.He had demanded, “It is time for the BJP to understand that more linguistic and cultural autonomy should be given to states.” The language war stroked in the guise of so-called Hindi imposition and protection of interests of Karnataka had led to mainstreaminging rabid lingiustic chauvinist groups like Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) which has been working in tandem with Congress party on host of issues for years. Reportedly, it is the KRV that led today’s violent protests across the city coercing shopkeepers and vendors to make an immediate transition and using Kannada on their signboards.During the Amul-Nandini fiasco, joining and supporting the then opposition party Congress’ narrative and call, Members of the ‘Kannada Rakshana Vedike’ had also hit the streets and staged protests against Amul while furthering its agenda of linguistic chauvinism and Hindi-imposition rhetoric.  During the Cauvery water dispute this year, organisations like KRV meet Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah to extend their support. They also called a bandh over the issue.Incidentally, just like the anti-farm law protest in New Delhi after the Centre passed three agriculture laws, the Karnataka Congress worked in tandem with outfits like KRV and staged violent protest against two amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms (KLR) Act and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act passed by the BS Yediyurappa government in 2020. Meanwhile, for several years, T-shirts with slogans like, “Hindi Gotthilla Hogo. Naavu Kannadigaru, Naavu Dravidaru” (We don’t know Hindi, go away. We are Kannadigas, we are Dravidians), have been allowed to go mainstream on social media platforms regularly. Similar campaigns have also been running in Tamil Nadu. A similar hashtag #ServeInMyLanguage had demanded that government services should be made available in Kannada for Kannada-speaking people. These hashtags started by the Kannada Grahakara Koota fan language divide and have been followed by groups like Karnataka Rakshana Vedike that hit the streets on to protest to fight against the so-called imposition of Hindi. Incidentally, these outfits have been on the same page with the Congress party in the state and vice-versa, emboldening them. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Interestingly, its standing as one of the favourite tourist attractions keeps growing with time. Many foreigners including famous individuals like Hugh Jackman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Julia Roberts, Will Smith and others frequently visit the country to experience its natural beauty, cuisine and culture among other things. Now, English and Albanian singer-songwriter Dua Lipa who has been vacationing here with her family is the newest addition to the long list of celebrities. “Happy Holidays from me to you. Sending love light health and happiness for the year ahead,” wrote the ‘Levitating’ hit-maker on 24th December with a heart emoticon as she posted a bunch of photos on Instagram while travelling in Rajasthan. She appeared to be having a wonderful time while admiring the state’s natural splendour and cultural nuisances. In the first photo, she posed in her bed in a blue shirt and striped pants while an exquisite artwork of Radha-Krishna adorned the background wall.A post shared by DUA LIPA (@dualipa)The following image showed the ‘One Kiss’ singer standing close to a desk while donning a crimson and golden dress. She also uploaded a snap of a group of women huddled up close to a building. The subsequent photograph featured her posing in black attire. Furthermore, she shared a slightly grainy picture of herself wearing a dark pair of sunglasses, a golden top and a leather jacket. The next one displayed her posing with her friends and then a close selfie of her face. Along with the stunning shots of the iconic Umaid Bhavan Palace in Jodhpur, she also published another image of herself seated in a car wearing jeans, a white shirt and a bright red jacket.After she pleasantly surprised her fans with the photographs from Rajasthan, her father Dukagjin Lipa took to the social media app and shared pictures from their amazing trip. He stated, “Jodhpur was captivating. Celebrating beautiful customs, beautifully preserved crafts, beautiful colours and beautiful people,” with folded hands and the Hindu symbol of ‘Om.’ He also tagged the luxury car brand Porsche and remarked, “This is the best form of transport,” and added auto-rikshaw emojis with the hashtag ‘tuk-tuk’ which is a popular three-wheeled motorized vehicle used as a taxi in the country. He also posted a series of photographs with his daughter and the rest of their family including them riding in an autorickshaw and a snap of a temple.A post shared by Dukagjin Lipa (@dukagjinlipa)Dukagjin Lipa also uploaded pictures from their visit to Humayun’s Tomb and Gurdwara Bangla Sahib in New Delhi and mentioned, “The Indian journey starts at New Delhi, India.” The family was clicked with their heads covered with saffron clothes inside the Gurdwara beside their picture outside the tomb. A post shared by Dukagjin Lipa (@dukagjinlipa)Notably, the well-known artist has been enjoying every minute of her vacation with no knowledge of her identity held by Indians. This blessing in disguise has allowed her to walk around freely, unlike when hordes of people congregate around any recognized face whenever they are noticed outside. However, she didn’t have to encounter any such issues and has been moving around with her family and friends without any problems. A clip showed her meandering casually around a marketplace while going undetected by the general population despite being a worldwide celebrity.Dua lipa ko na pahchaan ke Rajasthan walo ne usko, uski aukaat dikha di pic.twitter.com/9vXtHr9UB6The popular star was last seen in India as she made her debut performance in the country back in November 2019 when she commented, “At the Ganesh Temple in Jaipur. A lady outside the temple helped me and taught me how to put on my sari before I entered. We joined in with the locals and offered sweet treats to the Gods and the people inside.” The three-time Grammy Award winner has already celebrated Christmas in India this year and presumably is going to welcome the new year in the country as well.

If they want to stay back in Bangalore then they have to put nameplates on their shops in Kannada or else they have to move from Karnataka to other states.”He further said that there is a Karnataka government law that 60 per cent of the nameplate should be in Kannada.“No one is following it properly, so today we are doing a massive awareness protest rally. If the police stop us today, our struggle will not stop. We will continue the rally every day till our demands are met,” he added.He further alleged that Mall of Asia (Bengaluru) has not put a Kannada nameplate.“We told them to put a Kannada nameplate but Mall of Asia (Bangalore) did not bother and has not put a Kannada nameplate so we will fight against this.

"27 December, 2023 ","Former Pakistan FM Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who dreamed of ‘destroying Somnath temple’, manhandled and insulted by police after re-arrest outside jail",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/former-pakistan-fm-shah-mehmood-qureshi-manhandled-and-insulted-by-police-after-re-arrest/,"PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who was granted bail in the cipher case by the Supreme Court last week, was manhandled by police officials as they re-arrested him outside the Adiala Jail on Wednesday.
On Wednesday (27th December), Former Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who had vowed to destroy Somnath temple in India, was rearrested by the Pakistan Police hours after he was released from Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail in a cipher case. He was recently granted bail by the Pakistan Supreme Court in the given case. Qureshi, the Vice Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was arrested on 9th May in a GHQ protest case. The PTI released several videos across social media and claimed that the leader was manhandled and mistreated by the Pakistan Police. “Former Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi being mistreated by police officers as he was stating his rights. This is absolutely shameful, disgusting conduct by those who get paid by us!” the party said on X.

This is absolutely shameful, disgusting conduct by those who get paid by us! pic.twitter.com/ZVNtnqN0jS“I was released on bail by the Supreme Court, this is injustice, I am being punished for serving the nation,” Qureshi said while standing in an armored car. The videos, which were shared on the social media platform, showed Qureshi being pulled into the police van, with spectators asking the officers to be “careful” with the former minister.“Police have re-arrested Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi on bail release from Adyala Jail following the Supreme Court’s verdict last week. Earlier, the Deputy Commissioner of Rawalpindi had withdrawn the observation order issued under MPO. This treatment of a person with unparalleled service to Pakistan who are internationally respected senior politician is a sign of the arrogance of authority. The law has been made a joke and the fundamental constitutional rights of citizens have been openly violated. Pakistani people will never forget this oppression and injustice,” the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf wrote on Instagram. A post shared by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (@ptiofficial)On 22nd December, the Pakistan Supreme Court awarded bail to Qureshi and former Prime Minister Imran Khan in the cipher case. Given their involvement in other cases, their immediate release from jail was not possible.As the 67-year-old Qureshi was being discharged on Wednesday, a large contingent of police detained him again in the GHQ protest case and reportedly shifted him to an unknown location. According to the report, a case has been opened against Qureshi at the RA Bazar Police Station for attacking the GHQ during the 9th May riots.Qureshi was arrested a day after Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner (DC) Hassan Waqar Cheema delivered an order under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) for his 15-day imprisonment. This law allows the government to arrest someone if there is a risk of public disorder.Cheema stated in his order that the Rawalpindi city police officer (CPO) informed him that Qureshi was a member of a political party, engaged in anti-state activities, and triggered damage to public and private property during the 9th May protest.According to the Rawalpindi DC, Qureshi’s imprisonment is “necessary and expedient in (the) public interest” to prevent him from acting in any way that is detrimental to public safety or the maintenance of public order. Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s detention order was issued shortly before Special Court Judge Abual Hasnat Zulqarnain issued his release orders from the Adiala Jail in the cipher case.The March 2022 case involves Imran Khan waving a piece of paper at a public gathering and later naming the United States, claiming that the cipher was proof of an “international conspiracy” to destabilize his government. He made the allegations ahead of a vote of confidence, which he ultimately lost.Qureshi was Khan’s Foreign Minister at the time, and he was indicted in the cipher case in October last year. It is important to note that Qureshi in the year 2020 had vowed to destroy the Somnath Temple in India’s Gujarat. The vow of the video had gone viral over the social media platform. In the video, Qureshi could be heard saying how Shah Mehmood, like Mahmud Ghaznavi, has come out to destroy the Somnath temple. The crowd could be heard cheering for his vow in the background. 'Tolerant' Qureshi back in the day comparing himself to Mahmud of Ghaznavi out to demolish Somnath mandir. pic.twitter.com/TgTQLsrdcNThis video appears to be at least a decade old. The exact time of this speech of Qureshi cannot be verified.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"27 December, 2023 ",“Inciting people to establish Islamic rule”: MHA declares Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) ‘Unlawful Association’ under UAPA,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mha-bans-muslim-league-jammu-kashmir-masarat-alam-faction-under-uapa/,"The MHA issued a notification declaring that the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction), referred to as the MLJK-MA, chaired by Masarat Alam Bhat, is known for its anti-India and pro-Pakistan propaganda.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday declared the ‘Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction)’ MLJK-M as an ‘Unlawful Association’ under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act with immediate effect for the next five years, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah saying that “anyone acting against the unity, sovereignty, and integrity of our nation will not be spared and face the full wrath of the law”.The MHA issued a notification declaring that the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction), referred to as the MLJK-MA, chaired by Masarat Alam Bhat, is known for its anti-India and pro-Pakistan propaganda.The Ministry’s action against the group followed input that “the objectives of MLJK-MA are to get freedom of Jammu and Kashmir from India so as to realise the merger of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan and establish Islamic rule in Jammu and Kashmir.”“In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (37 of 1967), the Central Government hereby declares the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) as an unlawful association with immediate effect for a period of five years,” reads the notification.Soon after the notification was issued, the Home Minister took to ‘X’, formerly Twitter, mentioning that “the ‘Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction)’/MLJK-MA is declared as an ‘Unlawful Association’ under UAPA.”“This organization and its members are involved in anti-national and secessionist activities in J&K supporting terrorist activities and inciting people to establish Islamic rule in J&K. The PM @narendramodi government’s message is loud and clear that anyone acting against the unity, sovereignty, and integrity of our nation will not be spared and face the full wrath of the law,” Amit Shah posted on ‘X’.As per the MHA notification, the members of the MLJK-MA have been indulging in the secessionist activities in the Jammu and Kashmir, and the leaders and members of the group have been involved in raising funds through various sources including Pakistan and its proxy organisations for perpetrating unlawful activities, including supporting terrorist activities, sustained stone-pelting on Security Forces in Jammu and Kashmir.The notification points that the MLJK-MA and its members by their activities show sheer disrespect towards the constitutional authority and constitutional set up of the country; and its leaders and members, particularly its Chairman Masarat Alam Bhat, have been indulging in unlawful activities, which are prejudicial to the integrity, sovereignty, security and communalharmony of the country.The MHA said there had been a number of inputs showing linkages of the MLJK-MA with banned terrorist organisations; as well as the MLJK-MA and its members have been involved in supporting terrorist activities with an intent to create a reign of terror in the country, thereby endangering the security and public order of the state, and its anti-national activities also show disrespect and disregard to the constitutional authority and sovereignty of the state, hence an immediate and prompt action is required against the organisation.“The Central government is of the opinion that if there is no immediate curb or control of unlawful activities of the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction), it will use this opportunity to continue with the anti-national activities which are detrimental to the territorial integrity, security and sovereignty of the country; continue advocating the secession of Jammu and Kashmir from the Union of India while disputing its accession to the Union of India; andcontinue propagating false narratives and anti-national sentiments among the people of Jammu and Kashmir with the intention to cause disaffection against India and disrupt public order,” mentions the notification.Noting these reasons, the notification says, the Central government is firmly of the opinion that having regard to the activities of the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction), it is necessary to declare the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) as an ‘unlawful association’ with immediate effect. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

The young woman was killed and her friend was left seriously injured. The restaurant employees rushed both to a nearby hospital where she succumbed to her wounds while the latter was still under medical care. “The accused is absconding. Further investigation is underway,” proclaimed Dalbeer Singh who is the station house officer (SHO) of the local police station. Uma and Rajkumar went to the resturant-cum-bar which is located at SL Marg on the night of 25th December. After some time, Mangesh and his girlfriend arrived there, according to the first information report (FIR) that the injured victim filed, who is a partner in the establishment as well. Around eleven o’clock at night, he and Uma returned to the restaurant for dinner after checking out some construction being carried out on the rooftop.The official complaint informed, “The accused Mangesh was also having drinks with his girlfriend there. After some time, they started passing comments towards Uma. When Rajkumar objected, Mangesh said he already knew him.” The four then reportedly sat down and had a casual conversation but Mangesh attempted to touch Uma, based on a police officer who referenced the charges in the FIR filed in response to Rajkumar’s complaint.Later, they sat together and had a conversation. However, Mangesh tried to touch Uma, and was talking rudely to her.

After reaching Govardhan on Tuesday afternoon, they first visited and performed Puja at the Lautha temple of Poonchati. Afterwards, they started Dandavat Parikrama by lying down on the road among other devotees. There are security personnel accompanying them.Of the total 21 km parikrama, they circumambulated 3 km on the first day. Their circumambulation will be completed in about five days. Dandavat Parikrama involves prostrating in a ‘dandavat’ pose, then marking the place where the hand touches ground, and then proceeding to prostrate again on that spot. Notably, the temple of Giriraj Maharaj is in Govardhan, which falls in the Mathura region of UP and borders the Bharatpur district of Rajasthan. Lakhs of devotees come here to seek blessings and darshan. They perform this strenuous circumambulation on foot or by prostration. The entire parikrama is divided into two phases. The first parikrama is 12 kilometers while the second one is shorter and spans 9 kilometers. The total parikrama is thus 21 kilometers.Giriraj Maharaj is the Isht devata of CM Bhajanlal Sharma’s family. As per reports, he along with his family members have been doing the danadavat parikrama of Giriraj Ji Maharaj every year for more than a decade-and-a-half. However, because of his Chief Ministerial duties, this year he could not perform the parikrama. CM Bhajanlal Sharma is a resident of Attari village in the Nadbai area of Bharatpur district. His family is devout Hindu and has unwavering faith and devotion in their Isht Devta Giriraj ji.

There is a big idol of Baba in his house where the family regularly performs the puja. Kishan Swaroop and Gomti Devi have also been doing Dandavat Parikrama for years. However due to health reasons they could not participate in the Dandavat Parikrama this year.Earlier this month on 12th December, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), contrary to the media speculations, announced Bhajan Lal Sharma as the new CM-designate of Rajasthan, and on 15th December he was sworn in as the Chief Minister of the state. He is a first-time MLA and represents the Sanganer assembly constituency but he has organisational experience and served as state General Secretary for the party four times. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"27 December, 2023 ",I.N.D.I. Alliance non-starter in Punjab: Congress leaders oppose alliance with AAP for Lok Sabha elections while AAP wants to contest all seats,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/punjab-congress-leaders-oppose-alliance-with-aap-for-lok-sabha-elections/,"While AAP has shown a desire to contest all 13 seats in Punjab and one seat in Chandigarh alone on several occasions, Punjab Congress leadership has denied any possibility of contesting elections with the Kejriwal-led party.The chances of the Congress-Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alliance under the banner of I.N.D.I. Alliance are dimming as the 2024 Lok Sabha elections approach closer. While AAP has shown a desire to contest all 13 seats in Punjab and one seat in Chandigarh alone on several occasions, Punjab Congress leadership has denied any possibility of contesting elections with the Kejriwal-led party. On 26th December, it was reported that the majority of Punjab Congress leaders stood against the idea of an alliance with AAP for the General Elections during a meeting of Punjab’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC) chaired by All India Congress Committee president Mallikarjun Kharge in New Delhi. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was also present at the meeting.The party’s top leadership reportedly promised the Punjab Congress that the decision would be taken only after consultation with the state unit over the proposed alliance. The Congress leaders chose not to speak to the media after the meeting. However, as per Tribune’s sources, the Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, Pratap Singh Bajwa, former minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sangat Singh Gilzian and other leaders expressed their dismay over the idea of an alliance with Punjab.Furthermore, they spoke about the alleged political vendetta by AAP against the party leaders in the state. On the other hand, former PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and other MPs favoured joining hands with AAP in Punjab for the Lok Sabha elections. Reports suggest that 40 Congress leaders were present at the meeting. Out of these, 13 openly spoke about the issue. Several leaders told the top Congress leaders that party workers were against alliance with AAP in Punjab.Following their opposition to the tie-up with AAP, Gandhi and Kharge assured them that no decision had been taken so far and they would consult the local leaders before making any decision. Speaking to the media, state president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring refused to discuss the alliance with AAP. He said that the prime focus of the meeting was on election strategy, identifying the issues and strengthening the organisational structure. He said, “Leaders simply conveyed their views on the alliance to the high command, and there was no in-depth discussion on the issue.” Warring emphasised that the party leaders should express their views on the party platform only. He added, “If anyone wants to express his personal opinion, he will have to leave the party. Everyone has to maintain the party discipline, be it the PCC president, former president or block president.”Earlier, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal expressed his desire to contest all thirteen Lok Sabha seats in Punjab and one Lok Sabha seat in Chandigarh in the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections.During a public meeting in Bathinda, Punjab, with Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, Arvind Kejriwal said, “All these parties are sad. They feel that their jobs have been taken away permanently. No one is going to vote for them again. The way [AAP formed] government three times in Delhi, you will give a majority vote to AAP in the next elections. Lok Sabha elections are not far away. There are 13 seats in Punjab and one seat in Chandigarh. My heart says the way people benefit; you should give all 13 seats to us and make us strong.”On the other hand, the Punjab Congress has also opposed the idea of alliance. On 12th December, Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh Raja Warring said his party would contest all 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab. Furthermore, he added that the high command had not given any instructions for contesting the upcoming General elections in any alliance.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"27 December, 2023 ",‘Indian Communists are Chinese nationalists’: Netizens slam CPI(M) for eulogising Chinese mass murderer Mao Zedong,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/netizens-slam-cpim-for-eulogising-chinese-mass-murderer-mao-zedong/,"""We salute great revolutionary Mao on his birth anniversary, under whose leadership the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people were able to successfully carry out the people's democratic revolution!"" the post by CPI-M read. Citing the occasion of the 130th birth anniversary of China’s greatest mass murderer, Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) shared a post on social media in his remembrance and indicated that he was the greatest revolutionary who helped people carry out a democratic revolution.“We salute great revolutionary Mao on his birth anniversary, under whose leadership the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people were able to successfully carry out the people’s democratic revolution!” the post by CPI-M read. We salute great revolutionary Mao on his birth anniversary, under whose leadership the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people were able to successfully carry out the peoples democratic revolution! pic.twitter.com/UPzGaUsgXpNotably, the post was not that well-received by the Indian netizens who slammed the party for hailing and praising the greatest mass murderer in the history of the world. “Democratic revolution? The regime of Mao in China saw the deaths of over 6 Crore 50 Lakhs people due to starvation, overwork, and state violence during the Great Leap Forward. Shameful that Maoists are openly celebrating him in India,” said Supreme Court lawyer Shashank Shekhar Jha. “Democratic revolution”?Regime of Mao in 🇨🇳 has seen deaths of over 6 Crore 50 Lakhs people due to starvation, overwork and state violence during the Great Leap Forward.Shameful that Maoist are openly celebrating him in 🇮🇳Meanwhile, several other netizens mocked the party and asked its members to migrate to China only if they had to praise the mass murderer in India. One other user identified as Mahesh called Mao a horrible leader and wrote, “Mao Zedong was a disgrace and a horrible leader. He colluded with Japanese invaders throughout WW2. He had won 1962 war against India but his games were exposed. After that, he lost 1967 war against India, lost 1969 war against USSR, and had to withdraw from Vietnam in 1969.” Mao Zedong was a disgrace and a horrible leader.He colluded with Japanese invaders throughout WW2.He had won 1962 war against India but his games were exposed.After that, he lost 1967 war against India, lost 1969 war against USSR and had to withdraw from Vietnam in 1969.Some other users also criticised the party for praising the leader who is said to have killed around 45 millions in just four years, between 1958 and 1962.Earlier, a similar incident was reported in the year 2021 when the Congress had urged the Communist party to remove the portrait of former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, infamous for his brutality, from their offices in Kerala. This is days after the tyrannical Soviet leader’s terror mass grave was unearthed in Ukraine’s southern city of Odessa. As per various Russian accounts, a whopping 20 million people are said to have perished under Joseph Stalin’s regime, after being at the receiving end of labor camps, forced collectivization, famine, and executions.Besides these measures, Stalin had also initially colluded with the Nazis during the latter’s Polish invasion in 1939 and at the end of the war, the Communist soldiers under Stalin have been alleged to have raped at least 2 million German women. Stalin’s atrocities were not limited to the Soviet famine, he followed it by the ‘Great Purge’ where anyone who he disliked was sent to prison to be tortured or killed.The same model was adopted on a bigger scale by China’s Mao Zedong, which he called ‘The Great Leap Forward’. Like Stalin’s collectivization in Russia and Ukraine, Zedong’s collectivization caused man-made famines, food shortages, starvation, and poverty, which the communist rulers made worse by rationing food, torture, and brutalization.Mao Zedong’s ‘Great Leap Forward’ is called the single largest mass murder in the history of the world. Over 45 million Chinese were killed, starved, punished, and left to die. He killed over 45 million people in just four years, between 1958 and 1962. The worst part was the mannerism in which Zedong’s orders were enforced. 3 million people were killed just for the slightest infraction, like stealing a potato, hiding a handful of grains, and crimes as such. Such was the plight of the people that instances of cannibalism were reported from Chinese villages, people had tried to eat each other out of hunger. The CCP just refers to it as a ‘series of natural disasters’. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

And now, he is embarking on Bharat Nyay Yatra.There’s no stopping the whims and fancies of the Congress even if they come at the most questionable times and in the most questionable situation. The party, after losing 3 out of 4 assembly elections, has announced Bharat Jodo Yatra 2.0.On December 21st, the Congress Working Committee gave an opinion that Rahul Gandhi ji should start a yatra from east to west. Rahul Gandhi ji has also agreed to fulfill the wish of the CWC.So the All India Congress Committee has decided to hold a 'Bharat Nyay Yatra' from… pic.twitter.com/fkaD08PlNzCalled the ‘Bharat Nyay Yatra’, it will commence from 14th January to 20th March 2024 across 14 states covering 6,200 kilometres and 85 zillas. The yatra will cover the East to West distance from Manipur to Mumbai.The states through which the yatra will pass are Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra.𝗕𝗛𝗔𝗥𝗔𝗧 𝗡𝗬𝗔𝗬 𝗬𝗔𝗧𝗥𝗔The yatra will cover a distance of 6200 kms, spanning 14 states (Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat & Maharashtra) and 85 districts.The mode of the… pic.twitter.com/iqdrUsZqf0The Bharat Nyay Yatra was announced by AICC General Secretary KC Venugopal. During the press briefing, the party said that the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on 21st December gave an opinion that Rahul Gandhi should start the yatra from east to west.The way the Gandhi-Congress loyalists put it as was, “Rahul Gandhi ji has also agreed to fulfill the wish of the CWC.” Moreover, the mode of the yatra will be a “bus journey along with some short walks every now and then”.The timing of the yatra couldn’t be worse given that the party has lost to the BJP in three states and 2024 Lok Sabha elections will be held in the next few months.At the CWC meeting, the Gandhi-Congress lashed out on former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, former Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh for the electoral loss. However, no responsibility was taken by the so-called high command and their loyalists.As per reports, Rahul Gandhi said that the party did not campaign properly in the three states and was all praises for efforts in Telangana, where it won. And now, he is embarking on Bharat Nyay Yatra.Notably, at the CWC, Mukul Wasnik, Kerala MLA Ramesh Chennithala and Tripura legislator Sudeep Roy Barman were the only voice of reason saying that there was not enough time for the yatra.At the press briefing on Wednesday, the Congress said that Rahul Gandhi is embarking on the new yatra from the experience that he has gathered in the previous Bharat Jodo Yatra.The yatra is aimed at interacting with the youth, women and marginalised people. “This Bharat Nyay Yatra is going to be our most historic yatra,” said KC Venugopal.It must be pointed out that the achievements and accomplishments of the Bharat Jodo Yatra remain to be unclear. The three issues that Congress claims Rahul Gandhi had raised have failed to materialise into any result. These so-called issues were economic disparity, social polarisation and political tyranny.Jairam Ramesh said that the Bharat Nyay Yatra will call for ‘economic justice’, ‘social justice’ and ‘political justice’ for the people of India. This perhaps means that what the Congress and Rahul Gandhi could not achieve in the first round are attempting to achieve in the second.Safe to say that Rahul Gandhi had raised imaginary issues in his mind that naturally failed to make any point. And a repeat of a similar pattern can be expected with the Bharat Nyay Yatra.Whether the Bharat Nyay Yatra will spark a new set of controversies or repeat the same ones from the Bharat Jodo Yatra remains to be seen.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He is identified as Ashish Gupta who reportedly took a Muslim woman as his second wife after converting to Islam. The Tehsildar, Balram Gupta personally arrived at the location to look into the matter when the administration sensed something suspicious and afterwards learned of the development.The incident transpired in the Maudaha Police Station area where the accused went to offer Namaz in a mosque regularly for two days. He tried to conceal his real identity and introduced himself as Mohammed Yusuf from Kanpur when questions were raised because he was a stranger there. People were surprised when he informed them that he was Naib Tehsildar of Maudha Tehsil. The mosque management then immediately notified the authorities and officials reached the spot to probe the issue on the night of 25h December where they recorded statements of those in attendance.Muhammad Mushtaq, a cleric in the mosque stated that an unknown individual was coming to perform namaz repeatedly. He further disclosed, “We alerted the authorities after he claimed to be Mohammed Yusuf, a Kanpur resident and Naib Tehsildar of Maudaha. The Tehsildar arrived last night to inquire about the same. All of the witnesses’ statements have been documented and signed by the investigating officer.” The perpetrator has been posted in the region since 2nd September 2023 and hasn’t visited the religious place since the row erupted.

Bajrang Dal has demanded strict action from the administration.Ashish Gupta had been at the mosque for two days, per investigating officer Balram Gupta. The cop mentioned that he also discussed learning Urdu from someone but is unaware of the matter relating to Namaz. The officer did, however, ask the on-site religious scholars whether or not a follower of another faith is prohibited from performing namaz in a mosque to which they responded that there is no such objection, but they don’t want to be accused of anything in the instance.Additional District Magistrate Arun Mishra said that a probe has been launched. Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Rajesh Mishra remarked that a cleric from the mosque told them about the issue on the evening of 25th December following which a probe was conducted after the Tehsildar along with other cops arrived at the scene. The offender admitted that he had visited the mosque to study Urdu during the investigation which is currently ongoing and a report would be submitted to higher authorities.

The institution failed to show any papers of affiliation or recognition and children there are taught Islamic books. Almost all children there expresses a desire to become 'Muftis' when they grow up. On 26th December, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) paid a visit to a Madarsa in Punjab’s Chandigarh and discovered that children there are being frequently beaten. The Madarsa visited by NCPCR Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo is Madrasa Arabia Faizul Islam in Chandigarh. Kanoongo shared the video of the visit in which he could be seen inspecting the premises. He talked to the children residing in the Madarsa who revealed to him that 3 Hindu children also visit the Madarsa daily and are made to read Quran and Qaida. More than a dozen children residing in the Madarsa also revealed that around 300 children come to the Madarsa daily to learn Islamic books. आज चंडीगढ़ में मदरसा अरबिया फ़ैजुल इस्लाम का निरीक्षण किया,मदरसे में रहने वाले एक दर्जन से ज़्यादा बच्चे बिहार,उत्तरप्रदेश व हिमाचल के निवासी हैं परंतु यहीं मदरसे में रहते हैं।लगभग 300 बच्चे दिन में आते हैं शाम को वापिस चले जाते हैं, दिन में थोड़ी बहुत बुनियादी तालीम भी दी जाती… pic.twitter.com/lFzBXgWNJZAccording to the NCPCR, minors who reside in the Madarsa, are also beaten by the authorities, marks of which could be seen on their fingers in the video shared by Kanoongo. “More than a dozen children living in the Madrasa are residents of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal. Children are beaten in Madrasa, all have marks of beating on their fingers. Children are being groomed and brainwashed in such a way that instead of becoming doctors or engineers, they want to become muftis,” he said. Kanoongo, the chairperson of NCPCR also sought details about the education provided to the children at Madarsa but no details could be obtained. “some basic education is also given during the day, but the administration officials could not give any information about school-related recognition, affiliation, and government permission,” he added. As per the NCPCR inspection, the children at the Madarsa are groomed to become Muftis and very few are interested in becoming doctors, engineers, or scientists. It could be seen in the video that one or two among a dozen raised their hands when asked who wanted to become doctors or engineers, but all of them raised their hands and affirmed when asked whether they wanted to become Muftis. A mufti is an Islamic scholar who can legally rule on Islamic religious and personal matters. They are also authorized to make legal decisions or help judges in Islamic countries. Muftis are responsible for issuing a legal ruling or edict known as a fatwa. These rulings are non-binding and act as religious advice.The school is believed to be located in an urban locality and has no library or computer-aided learning lab. The school provides only basic education to children from class 1 to 8. It was established in the year 1991 and is believed to have attained no government permission to run a school. “The administration officials could not give any information about school-related recognition, affiliation, and government permission,” Kanoongo affirmed.The NCPCR visited the Madarsa on 26th December and sought relevant answers from the authority.

According to a police officer, “Vinod had gone to Abdullah’s house to demand his dues, about Rs 1,000-1,500. He did not find Abdullah there, which made him angry and he shouted at his family members. When Abdullah came to know about the misbehaviour, it irked him. The following day, he went to Vinod’s place and an argument took place between them. Abdullah then stabbed Vinod multiple times, causing his death.” According to the police, Abdullah admitted to the crime, stating that he murdered Vinod because Vinod had insulted his family.Vinod’s family members have accused Abdullah of stealing Rs 25000 and two mobile phones after he killed Vinod. In an interaction with the media, Vinod’s aunt Taravati said, “A day before the murder, Abdullah had come here in the night. Both were fighting with each other. Vinod was asking him to return his Rs 800. Vinod said to Abdullah, ‘Brother, you have taken money as a hand loan from me, please return it to me I need it’. He did not give the money back. Then they abused each other. Mohammad Abdullah went back to his home.”She further said, “The next day, Vinod’s brother Lokesh (alias Lucky) woke up in the morning. He gave tea to Vinod at around 10:30 a.m. Vinod slept again. His brother went to job. Abdullah visited the locality thrice. After Lucky went out for his job, Abdulah came upstairs. He killed Vinod in 10 minutes and vanished. He stabbed Vinod 11 times in the abdomen. Vinod was stabbed in the liver and Vinod’s intestine was also torn in the attack.”She added, “None of us relatives was here at that time.

She also noticed that his body was cold. She then shouted and cried aloud to inform the others. Then everyone else including the police was called.

Abdullah stole Rs 25000 from the cupboard. It was the amount hard earned and saved by these two brothers. Abdullah also stole a wallet and two mobile phones including a new phone worth Rs 15000 to 20000. He also took one Samsung phone. Vinod was an earning hand in the family. His sister has lost vision in her one eye. Their parents passed away when these siblings were very young.”Taravati did not confirm that Vinod visited Abdullah’s place and insulted his family. She said that the altercation between the two took place just outside Vinod’s residence. She said, “The fight took place just here only. Vinod asked him to return the money. Abdullah denied. As a result, they argued. The next day, Abdullah visited the locality three times. He was angry. Spotting Vinod alone at the house, he came upstairs and stabbed him 11 times until he died. He then puts his dead body upside down so that anyone who sees Vinod should feel that he is asleep. When Vinod’s sister came and turned him up, she saw that his intestine was lying outside.”She further said, “Vinod was an earning member of the family. He helped his sister. His sister lives with her two kids. There is no one else with her. Who will support them now? Whatever amount he had saved, Abdullah took it away after the murder. What if the house owner asks his brother to leave this place? Where will he go?”The police investigation has revealed that Mohammad Abdulla is a drug addict. Informing more about the drug addiction among youths in this area, Taravati said, “Even young kids in this area consume hukka. They get this addiction at the age of 16 or 17.
